    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "\n",
    "a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem? Maybe there is too much noise with overlapping basic words that makes 2 pieces of text seem more similar than they really are. Every word has an even weight and the text excerpts vary quite a bit in length. The longest excerpts will have lots of pull in this model because it will show lots of neighbors near it.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes? Logistic regression doesn't handle lots of features especially well in this instance because the model is overfitting the data--its allocating all of the variance to the possible words so the model isn't generalizing well. NB  banks on the independance of features, and obviously we know that words are not independent so perhaps NB captures the relationship between words better.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. The higher the regularization weight (C), the larger the the sum of the squared weight values is for all classes. The regularization term de-emphasizes features that don't add much value when it is lower, when it's larger it looks like it amplyfies the noise associated with larger features."

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular. With your new preprocessor, how much did you reduce the size of the dictionary?\n",

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",

    "ANSWER: TfidfVectorizer -- how is this different from the CountVectorizer? The term frequency inverse document frequency weighs the importance of the features given the length of the overall message so that longer messages don't carry additional importance in the model just because they are longer. The model does not do a very good job of considering the associations between words, it would be cool to build a long short term memory model to adjust for some of those relationships, phrases like \"book of Mormon\" might be picked up on as much more significant. Maybe after 205! It would also be interesting to try and merge the model with some pretrained text like word2vec to see if more established vernacular could assist with the identification of false red flags such at email, internet, and ftp seen in a few of the examples above."
