    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

address to reply to                  NUM   what is jpeg   jpeg  pronounced  jay peg   is a standardized image compression mechanism  jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group  the original name of the committee that wrote the standard   jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of  natural   real world scenes  it does not work so well on non realistic images  such as cartoons or line drawings   jpeg does not handle black and white  NUM bit per pixel  images  nor does it handle motion picture compression   standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees  named jbig and mpeg respectively   jpeg is  lossy   meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in   the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye  notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark   thus  jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans   if you plan to machine analyze your images  the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you  even if they are invisible to the eye   a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters   this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality   you can make  extremely  small files if you don t mind poor quality  this is useful for indexing image archives  making thumbnail views or icons  etc  etc   conversely  if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting  you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied  and accept lesser compression     NUM   why use jpeg   there are two good reasons  to make your image files smaller  and to store NUM bit per pixel color data instead of NUM bit per pixel data   making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images   being able to compress a NUM mbyte full color file down to NUM kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time    if you are comparing gif and jpeg  the size ratio is more like four to one   more details below    if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly  you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images   even with a jpeg capable viewer  it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format  gif  for instance    thus  using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff  you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply   it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved  the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file   i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself   the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information  NUM bits pixel  NUM million colors  instead of NUM or less  NUM or fewer colors    if you have only NUM bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you   within a couple of years  though  NUM bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today   furthermore  for reasons detailed in section NUM  jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware   hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard     NUM   when should i use jpeg  and when should i stick with gif   jpeg is  not  going to displace gif entirely  for some types of images  gif is superior in image quality  file size  or both   one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to   as a rule of thumb  jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of  realistic  scenes  that means scanned photographs and similar material   jpeg is superior even if you don t have NUM bit display hardware  and it is a lot superior if you do    see section NUM for details    gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors  such as cartoons and line drawings   in particular  large areas of pixels that are all  exactly  the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif   jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects   this sort of image is best kept in gif form   in particular  single color borders are quite cheap in gif files  but they should be avoided in jpeg files    jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges  a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels  for example   sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting   again  this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs  but it shows up fairly often in gif files  borders  overlaid text  etc   the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high  if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text  don t jpeg it   computer drawn images  ray traced scenes  for instance  usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity   the more complex and subtly rendered the image  the more likely that jpeg will do well on it  the same goes for semi realistic artwork  fantasy drawings and such    plain black and white  two level  images should never be converted to jpeg  you need at least about NUM gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images   it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to NUM levels  while jpeg is not   if you have an existing library of gif images  you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg   you will lose a little image quality if you do   section NUM  which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif  only applies if both formats start from a full color original   if you start from a gif  you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information  jpeg can only make things worse    however  the disk space savings may justify converting anyway   this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself  if you do convert a gif library to jpeg  see section NUM for hints   be prepared to leave some images in gif format  since some gifs will not convert well     NUM   how well does jpeg compress images   pretty darn well   here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy  a

but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes   note that this file is tiny      the compression ratio from the original is NUM NUM    in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality  the  q NUM file is every bit as good as the gif  better if you have a full color display    this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes     NUM   what are good  quality  settings for jpeg   most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs  image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting   there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings    quality NUM  does not mean  keep NUM  of the information   as some have claimed   the quality scale is purely arbitrary  it s not a percentage of anything   the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting  smallest file size  that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original   this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another  but here are some rules of thumb   the default quality setting   q NUM  is very often the best choice   this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image   try  q NUM first  if you see defects  then go up   except for experimental purposes  never go above  q NUM  saying  q NUM will produce a file two or three times as large as  q NUM  but of hardly any better quality   if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with  you might be able to go down to  q NUM without objectionable degradation   on the other hand  you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation  the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg  the default  q NUM is about right for compressing NUM bit images  but  q NUM to NUM is usually better for converting gifs  see section NUM for more info    if you want a very small file  say for preview or indexing purposes  and are prepared to tolerate large defects  a  q setting in the range of NUM to NUM is about right    q NUM or so may be amusing as  op art     note  the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section NUMb  and to many programs based on it   other jpeg implementations  such as image alchemy  may use a completely different quality scale   some programs don t even provide a numeric scale  just  high   medium   low  style choices      NUM   where can i get jpeg software   most of the programs described in this

if you don t see what you want for your machine  check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list   note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet  but some commercial programs are listed too   x windows   xv  shareware   NUM  is an excellent viewer for jpeg  gif  and many other image formats   it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations   it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu  NUM NUM NUM NUM   file contrib xv NUM NUM tar z   version NUM NUM is a major upgrade with support for NUM bit displays and many other improvements  however  it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking   if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge  stick with version NUM NUM  also available from export   note that version NUM NUM is not a good choice if you have a NUM bit display  you ll get only NUM bit color   nor for converting NUM bit images to jpeg   but NUM NUM works fine for converting gif and other NUM bit images to jpeg   caution  there is a glitch in version NUM NUM  be sure to check the  save at normal size  checkbox when saving a jpeg file  or the file will be blurry   another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package  also available from export lcs mit edu  file contrib imagemagick tar z  this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks   the imagemagick viewer handles NUM bit displays correctly  for colormapped displays  it does better  though slower  color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software   both of the above are large  complex packages   if you just want a simple image viewer  try xloadimage or xli   xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release  NUM NUM   xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu  file contrib xloadimage NUM NUM tar z   xli is a variant version of xloadimage  said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original   the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage  at least with respect to jpeg files  because it has the ijg vNUM decoder while xloadimage NUM NUM is using a hacked over vNUM   the next xloadimage

s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably   note  installation is a bit tricky  read the directions carefully   a shareware alternative is colorview for dos   NUM    this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives   its user interface is also much spiffier looking  although personally i find it harder to use     more keystrokes  inconsistent

quantization   most people don t have full color  NUM bit per pixel  display hardware  typical display hardware stores NUM or fewer bits per pixel  so it can display NUM or fewer distinct colors at a time   to display a full color image  the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors   this process is called  color quantization     this is something of a misnomer   color selection  would be a better term   we re stuck with the standard usage though    clearly  color quantization is a lossy process   it turns out that for most images  the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg  except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings    since jpeg is a full color format  converting a color jpeg image for display on NUM bit or less hardware requires color quantization   this is true for  all  color jpegs  even if you feed a NUM or less color gif into jpeg  what comes out of the decompressor is  not  NUM colors  but thousands of colors  this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently  so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors   each original color gets  smeared  into a group of nearby colors   therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display  regardless of the image source   the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output    incidentally  because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image   even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values  different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences   i occasionally see posted images described as  NUM color jpeg    this tells me that the poster  a  hasn t read this faq and  b  probably converted the jpeg from a gif  jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale  just like photographs   but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg    on the other hand  a gif image by definition has already been quantized to NUM or fewer colors    a gif  does  have a definite number of colors in its palette  and the format doesn t allow more than NUM palette entries   for purposes of usenet picture distribution  gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization  so recipients don t have to  this is also the  disadvantage  of gif  you re stuck with the sender s quantization   if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display  you have to re quantize  resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image  furthermore  if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm  you re out of luck   for this reason  jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware  jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware   furthermore  you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms  there is a lot of active research in this area   or purchase better display hardware  to get a better view of jpeg images you already have   with a gif  you re stuck forevermore with what was sent   it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines   if you view a NUM color gif on a NUM color ega display  for example  you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to   this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations  one to create the gif  one to display it   but often it s also due to sloppiness   jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all  and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed   thus  jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones   finally  an ever growing number of people have better than NUM bit display hardware already  NUM bit  hi color  pc displays  true NUM bit displays on workstations and macintoshes  etc   for these people  gif is already obsolete  as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display   jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively  thus  jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion     NUM   how does jpeg work   the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling  discrete cosine transforms  coefficient quantization  and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding   this article s long enough already  so i m not going to say more than that here   for technical information  see the comp compression faq  this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu  in files  pub usenet news answers compression faq part NUM NUM    if you need help in using the news answers archive  see the top of this article     NUM   what about lossless jpeg   there s a great deal of confusion on this subject   the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm  i e   one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input   however  this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular  lossy jpeg algorithm  and it offers much less compression   at present  very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist  and all of them are commercial   saying   q NUM  to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image  what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step   there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step    with the vNUM free jpeg code  you can also say   sample NUMxNUM  to turn off subsampling   keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file    even with both quantization and subsampling turned off  the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless  because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations   the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value  it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye  but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image   at this minimum loss setting  regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed NUM bit per pixel image   true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression  but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy   if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than NUM bits per pixel  per color component   you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard   this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images   jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with NUM or more bits per pixel  furthermore  jpeg is public domain  at least with a huffman back end   while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents     NUM   why all the argument about file formats   strictly speaking  jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms  it does  not  refer to a specific image file format   the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations   since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format  this leaves us with a problem   in the absence of official standards  a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to  do their own thing   and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s   the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems   they have defined two jpeg based file formats      jfif  jpeg file interchange format   a  low end  format that transports     pixels and not much else      tiff jpeg  aka tiff NUM NUM  an extension of the aldus tiff format   tiff is     a  high end  format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image  and a lot more besides       tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif  and may well prove less transportable      because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff   it s not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation  both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products  it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards   i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings   jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now  the tiff NUM NUM spec has only recently been officially adopted  and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details   even when tiff jpeg is well defined  the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported  lowest common denominator   tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable   a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh   quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure   conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward  and several mac programs are available to do it  see mac portion of section NUMa    if you have an editor that handles binary files  you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand  see section NUM for details   another particular case is handmade software s programs  gifNUMjpg jpgNUMgif and image alchemy    these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format   by default  though  they write a proprietary format developed by hsi   this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings   use the  j switch to get jfif output    this applies to old versions of these programs  the current releases emit jfif format by default   you still should be careful not to post hsi format files  unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms      NUM   how do i recognize which file format i have  and what do i do about it   if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read  it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format   you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file   NUM   a jfif standard file will start with the characters  hex  ff dNUM ff eNUM      followed by two variable bytes  often hex NUM NUM   followed by  jfif    NUM   if you see ff dNUM at the start  but not the rest of it  you may have a      raw jpeg  file   this is probably decodable as is by jfif software         it s worth a try  anyway   NUM   hsi files start with  hsiNUM    you re out of luck unless you have hsi     software   portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data  but they     won t decompress properly with non hsi programs   NUM   a macintosh pict file  if jpeg compressed  will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header  scan for  jfif     strip off     everything before the ff dNUM and you should be able to read it   NUM   anything else  it s a proprietary format  or not jpeg at all   if you are     lucky  the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream      if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream  look for ff dNUM       try stripping off everything before that   in uuencoded usenet postings  the characteristic jfif pattern is    begin  line  m_ c_x      whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with    begin  line  m   i      if you learn to check for the former  you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files     NUM   what about arithmetic coding   the jpeg spec defines two different  back end  modules for the final output of compressed data  either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed  the choice has no impact on image quality  but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file   on typical images  arithmetic coding produces a file NUM or NUM percent smaller than huffman coding    all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding    unfortunately  the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm  at t  and mitsubishi  thus  you cannot legally use arithmetic coding  unless you obtain licenses from these companies    the  fair use  doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm  but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best    at least in the short run  i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding  the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles   in particular  arithmetic coding  should not  be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet   there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future   stay tuned for further details     NUM   does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression   it would be nice if  having compressed an image with jpeg  you could decompress it  manipulate it  crop off a border  say   and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially  unfortunately this is not the case   in general  recompressing an altered image loses more information  though usually not as much as was lost the first time around   the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it  without changing it  then there is no further loss  i e   you get an identical jpeg file   even this is not true  at least  not with the current free jpeg software   it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error   if you repeatedly compress and decompress  the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output    it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change   one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited  but i am not optimistic about it   in any case  the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg  at the original quality setting  would introduce no further loss   even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation   if you re wondering why  it s because the pixel block boundaries move  if you cropped off only multiples of NUM pixels  you might be safe  but that s a mighty limited capability    the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images  but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps   use a lossless format  ppm  rle  tiff  etc  while working on the image  then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away   aside from avoiding degradation  you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way         NUM   what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg   as stated earlier  you  will  lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg   if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from  it s far better to make a jpeg from that   but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from  here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality   the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg  to make sure you are happy with it  before throwing away the corresponding gif  that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary   some gifs may be better left as gifs  as explained in section NUM  in particular  cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well   you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be  larger  than the gif    so check the sizes too    experience to date suggests that large  high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg   they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings  and they convert to jpeg with least degradation  don t waste your time converting any gif much under NUM kbytes   also  don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals   to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be  i e   shoot for NUM NUM or NUM NUMrd the size of the gif file  not NUM NUMth as suggested in earlier comparisons    many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image   while useless  this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files   it is not free in jpeg files  and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts   ghost  edges    do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging    if you are on an x windows system  xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this    cjpeg s default q setting of NUM is appropriate for full color input  but for gif inputs  q settings of NUM to NUM often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation    if you apply smoothing as suggested below  the higher q setting may not be necessary    color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually  dithered  to fool your eye into seeing more than the NUM colors that gif can actually store  if you enlarge the image  you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors  at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value   the trouble with dithering is that  to jpeg  it looks like high spatial frequency color noise  and jpeg can t compress noise very well   the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image  if you had it   to get around this  you want to  smooth  the gif image before compression  smoothing averages together nearby pixels  thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway  and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble   appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor  thus further reducing the size of the compressed file  while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing   with the vNUM free jpeg software  or products based on it   a simple smoothing capability is built in   try   smooth NUM  or so when converting gifs  values of NUM to NUM seem to work well for high quality gifs   heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors    if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement  then strong smoothing is definitely called for    too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image  which you don t want   if you are an image processing wizard  you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program  such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package   however  cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol     the upshot of all this is that  cjpeg  quality NUM  smooth NUM  is probably a good starting point for converting gifs   but if you really care about the image  you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings                           for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular  contact the

address to reply to                  NUM   what is jpeg   jpeg  pronounced  jay peg   is a standardized image compression mechanism  jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group  the original name of the committee that wrote the standard   jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of  natural   real world scenes  it does not work so well on non realistic images  such as cartoons or line drawings   jpeg does not handle black and white  NUM bit per pixel  images  nor does it handle motion picture compression   standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees  named jbig and mpeg respectively   jpeg is  lossy   meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in   the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye  notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark   thus  jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans   if you plan to machine analyze your images  the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you  even if they are invisible to the eye   a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters   this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality   you can make  extremely  small files if you don t mind poor quality  this is useful for indexing image archives  making thumbnail views or icons  etc  etc   conversely  if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting  you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied  and accept lesser compression     NUM   why use jpeg   there are two good reasons  to make your image files smaller  and to store NUM bit per pixel color data instead of NUM bit per pixel data   making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images   being able to compress a NUM mbyte full color file down to NUM kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time    if you are comparing gif and jpeg  the size ratio is more like four to one   more details below    if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly  you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images   even with a jpeg capable viewer  it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format  gif  for instance    thus  using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff  you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply   it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved  the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file   i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself   the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information  NUM bits pixel  NUM million colors  instead of NUM or less  NUM or fewer colors    if you have only NUM bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you   within a couple of years  though  NUM bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today   furthermore  for reasons detailed in section NUM  jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware   hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard     NUM   when should i use jpeg  and when should i stick with gif   jpeg is  not  going to displace gif entirely  for some types of images  gif is superior in image quality  file size  or both   one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to   as a rule of thumb  jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of  realistic  scenes  that means scanned photographs and similar material   jpeg is superior even if you don t have NUM bit display hardware  and it is a lot superior if you do    see section NUM for details    gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors  such as cartoons and line drawings   in particular  large areas of pixels that are all  exactly  the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif   jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects   this sort of image is best kept in gif form   in particular  single color borders are quite cheap in gif files  but they should be avoided in jpeg files    jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges  a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels  for example   sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting   again  this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs  but it shows up fairly often in gif files  borders  overlaid text  etc   the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high  if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text  don t jpeg it   computer drawn images  ray traced scenes  for instance  usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity   the more complex and subtly rendered the image  the more likely that jpeg will do well on it  the same goes for semi realistic artwork  fantasy drawings and such    plain black and white  two level  images should never be converted to jpeg  you need at least about NUM gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images   it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to NUM levels  while jpeg is not   if you have an existing library of gif images  you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg   you will lose a little image quality if you do   section NUM  which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif  only applies if both formats start from a full color original   if you start from a gif  you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information  jpeg can only make things worse    however  the disk space savings may justify converting anyway   this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself  if you do convert a gif library to jpeg  see section NUM for hints   be prepared to leave some images in gif format  since some gifs will not convert well     NUM   how well does jpeg compress images   pretty darn well   here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy  a NUMxNUM full color image of a ship in a harbor   the first three files are for comparison purposes  the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section NUMb   file    size in bytes  comments  ship ppm NUM  original file in ppm format  no compression  NUM bits     or NUM bytes per pixel  plus a few bytes overhead  ship ppm z  NUM  ppm file passed through unix compress     compress doesn t accomplish a lot  you ll note      other text oriented compressors give similar results  ship gif  NUM  converted to gif with ppmquant  fs NUM   ppmtogif     most of the savings is the result of losing color     info  gif saves NUM bits pixel  not NUM    see sec  NUM    ship jpgNUM  NUM  cjpeg  q NUM     highest useful quality setting      this is indistinguishable from the NUM bit original      at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs  ship jpgNUM   NUM  cjpeg  q NUM     default setting      you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this     from the original  even with both on screen at once  ship jpgNUM   NUM  cjpeg  q NUM     this has slight defects  if you know what to look     for  you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing     the original   still as good image quality as many     recent postings in usenet pictures groups  ship jpgNUM   NUM  cjpeg  q NUM     jpeg s characteristic  blockiness  becomes apparent     at this setting  djpeg  blocksmooth helps some       still  i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were     of poorer image quality than this  ship jpgNUMo    NUM  cjpeg  q NUM  optimize    optimize cuts table overhead      blocky  but perfectly satisfactory for preview or     indexing purposes   note that this file is tiny      the compression ratio from the original is NUM NUM    in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality  the  q NUM file is every bit as good as the gif  better if you have a full color display    this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes     NUM   what are good  quality  settings for jpeg   most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs  image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting   there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings    quality NUM  does not mean  keep NUM  of the information   as some have claimed   the quality scale is purely arbitrary  it s not a percentage of anything   the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting  smallest file size  that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original   this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another  but here are some rules of thumb   the default quality setting   q NUM  is very often the best choice   this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image   try  q NUM first  if you see defects  then go up   except for experimental purposes  never go above  q NUM  saying  q NUM will produce a file two or three times as large as  q NUM  but of hardly any better quality   if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with  you might be able to go down to  q NUM without objectionable degradation   on the other hand  you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation  the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg  the default  q NUM is about right for compressing NUM bit images  but  q NUM to NUM is usually better for converting gifs  see section NUM for more info    if you want a very small file  say for preview or indexing purposes  and are prepared to tolerate large defects  a  q setting in the range of NUM to NUM is about right    q NUM or so may be amusing as  op art     note  the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section NUMb  and to many programs based on it   other jpeg implementations  such as image alchemy  may use a completely different quality scale   some programs don t even provide a numeric scale  just  high   medium   low  style choices      NUM   where can i get jpeg software   most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp  if you don t know how to use ftp  see the faq article  how to find sources    if you don t have direct access to ftp  read about ftpmail servers in the same article    that article appears regularly in news answers  or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with  send usenet news answers finding sources  in the body   the  anonymous ftp list

jpeg faq from the news answers archive     NUMa   if you are looking for  canned  software  viewers  etc   the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system   if you don t see what you want for your machine  check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list   note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet  but some commercial programs are listed too   x windows   xv  shareware   NUM  is an excellent viewer for jpeg  gif  and many other image formats   it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations   it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu  NUM NUM NUM NUM   file contrib xv NUM NUM tar z   version NUM NUM is a major upgrade with support for NUM bit displays and many other improvements  however  it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking   if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge  stick with version NUM NUM  also available from export   note that version NUM NUM is not a good choice if you have a NUM bit display  you ll get only NUM bit color   nor for converting NUM bit images to jpeg   but NUM NUM works fine for converting gif and other NUM bit images to jpeg   caution  there is a glitch in version NUM NUM  be sure to check the  save at normal size  checkbox when saving a jpeg file  or the file will be blurry   another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package  also available from export lcs mit edu  file contrib imagemagick tar z  this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks   the imagemagick viewer handles NUM bit displays correctly  for colormapped displays  it does better  though slower  color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software   both of the above are large  complex packages   if you just want a simple image viewer  try xloadimage or xli   xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release  NUM NUM   xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu  file contrib xloadimage NUM NUM tar z   xli is a variant version of xloadimage  said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original   the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage  at least with respect to jpeg files  because it has the ijg vNUM decoder while xloadimage NUM NUM is using a hacked over vNUM   the next xloadimage

quantization   most people don t have full color  NUM bit per pixel  display hardware  typical display hardware stores NUM or fewer bits per pixel  so it can display NUM or fewer distinct colors at a time   to display a full color image  the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors   this process is called  color quantization     this is something of a misnomer   color selection  would be a better term   we re stuck with the standard usage though    clearly  color quantization is a lossy process   it turns out that for most images  the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg  except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings    since jpeg is a full color format  converting a color jpeg image for display on NUM bit or less hardware requires color quantization   this is true for  all  color jpegs  even if you feed a NUM or less color gif into jpeg  what comes out of the decompressor is  not  NUM colors  but thousands of colors  this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently  so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors   each original color gets  smeared  into a group of nearby colors   therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display  regardless of the image source   the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output    incidentally  because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image   even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values  different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences   i occasionally see posted images described as  NUM color jpeg    this tells me that the poster  a  hasn t read this faq and  b  probably converted the jpeg from a gif  jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale  just like photographs   but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg    on the other hand  a gif image by definition has already been quantized to NUM or fewer colors    a gif  does  have a definite number of colors in its palette  and the format doesn t allow more than NUM palette entries   for purposes of usenet picture distribution  gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization  so recipients don t have to  this is also the  disadvantage  of gif  you re stuck with the sender s quantization   if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display  you have to re quantize  resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image  furthermore  if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm  you re out of luck   for this reason  jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware  jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware   furthermore  you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms  there is a lot of active research in this area   or purchase better display hardware  to get a better view of jpeg images you already have   with a gif  you re stuck forevermore with what was sent   it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines   if you view a NUM color gif on a NUM color ega display  for example  you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to   this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations  one to create the gif  one to display it   but often it s also due to sloppiness   jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all  and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed   thus  jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones   finally  an ever growing number of people have better than NUM bit display hardware already  NUM bit  hi color  pc displays  true NUM bit displays on workstations and macintoshes  etc   for these people  gif is already obsolete  as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display   jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively  thus  jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion     NUM   how does jpeg work   the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling  discrete cosine transforms  coefficient quantization  and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding   this article s long enough already  so i m not going to say more than that here   for technical information  see the comp compression faq  this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu  in files  pub usenet news answers compression faq part NUM NUM    if you need help in using the news answers archive  see the top of this article     NUM   what about lossless jpeg   there s a great deal of confusion on this subject   the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm  i e   one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input   however  this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular  lossy jpeg algorithm  and it offers much less compression   at present  very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist  and all of them are commercial   saying   q NUM  to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image  what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step   there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step    with the vNUM free jpeg code  you can also say   sample NUMxNUM  to turn off subsampling   keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file    even with both quantization and subsampling turned off  the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless  because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations   the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value  it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye  but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image   at this minimum loss setting  regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed NUM bit per pixel image   true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression  but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy   if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than NUM bits per pixel  per color component   you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard   this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images   jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with NUM or more bits per pixel  furthermore  jpeg is public domain  at least with a huffman back end   while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents     NUM   why all the argument about file formats   strictly speaking  jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms  it does  not  refer to a specific image file format   the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations   since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format  this leaves us with a problem   in the absence of official standards  a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to  do their own thing   and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s   the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems   they have defined two jpeg based file formats      jfif  jpeg file interchange format   a  low end  format that transports     pixels and not much else      tiff jpeg  aka tiff NUM NUM  an extension of the aldus tiff format   tiff is     a  high end  format that will let you record just about everything you     ever wanted to know about an image  and a lot more besides       tiff is     a lot more complex than jfif  and may well prove less transportable      because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different     and incompatible subsets of tiff   it s not likely that adding jpeg to the     mix will do anything to improve this situation  both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products  it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards   i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings   jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now  the tiff NUM NUM spec has only recently been officially adopted  and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details   even when tiff jpeg is well defined  the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported  lowest common denominator   tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable   a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh   quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure   conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward  and several mac programs are available to do it  see mac portion of section NUMa    if you have an editor that handles binary files  you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand  see section NUM for details   another particular case is handmade software s programs  gifNUMjpg jpgNUMgif and image alchemy    these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format   by default  though  they write a proprietary format developed by hsi   this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings   use the  j switch to get jfif output    this applies to old versions of these programs  the current releases emit jfif format by default   you still should be careful not to post hsi format files  unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms      NUM   how do i recognize which file format i have  and what do i do about it   if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read  it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format   you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file   NUM   a jfif standard file will start with the characters  hex  ff dNUM ff eNUM      followed by two variable bytes  often hex NUM NUM   followed by  jfif    NUM   if you see ff dNUM at the start  but not the rest of it  you may have a      raw jpeg  file   this is probably decodable as is by jfif software         it s worth a try  anyway   NUM   hsi files start with  hsiNUM    you re out of luck unless you have hsi     software   portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data  but they     won t decompress properly with non hsi programs   NUM   a macintosh pict file  if jpeg compressed  will have a couple hundred     bytes of header followed by a jfif header  scan for  jfif     strip off     everything before the ff dNUM and you should be able to read it   NUM   anything else  it s a proprietary format  or not jpeg at all   if you are     lucky  the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream      if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream  look for ff dNUM       try stripping off everything before that   in uuencoded usenet postings  the characteristic jfif pattern is    begin  line  m_ c_x      whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with    begin  line  m   i      if you learn to check for the former  you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files     NUM   what about arithmetic coding   the jpeg spec defines two different  back end  modules for the final output of compressed data  either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed  the choice has no impact on image quality  but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file   on typical images  arithmetic coding produces a file NUM or NUM percent smaller than huffman coding    all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding    unfortunately  the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm  at t  and mitsubishi  thus  you cannot legally use arithmetic coding  unless you obtain licenses from these companies    the  fair use  doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm  but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best    at least in the short run  i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding  the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles   in particular  arithmetic coding  should not  be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet   there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future   stay tuned for further details     NUM   does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression   it would be nice if  having compressed an image with jpeg  you could decompress it  manipulate it  crop off a border  say   and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially  unfortunately this is not the case   in general  recompressing an altered image loses more information  though usually not as much as was lost the first time around   the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it  without changing it  then there is no further loss  i e   you get an identical jpeg file   even this is not true  at least  not with the current free jpeg software   it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error   if you repeatedly compress and decompress  the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output    it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change   one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited  but i am not optimistic about it   in any case  the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg  at the original quality setting  would introduce no further loss   even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation   if you re wondering why  it s because the pixel block boundaries move  if you cropped off only multiples of NUM pixels  you might be safe  but that s a mighty limited capability    the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images  but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps   use a lossless format  ppm  rle  tiff  etc  while working on the image  then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away   aside from avoiding degradation  you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way         NUM   what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg   as stated earlier  you  will  lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg   if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from  it s far better to make a jpeg from that   but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from  here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality   the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg  to make sure you are happy with it  before throwing away the corresponding gif  that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary   some gifs may be better left as gifs  as explained in section NUM  in particular  cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well   you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be  larger  than the gif    so check the sizes too    experience to date suggests that large  high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg   they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings  and they convert to jpeg with least degradation  don t waste your time converting any gif much under NUM kbytes   also  don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals   to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be  i e   shoot for NUM NUM or NUM NUMrd the size of the gif file  not NUM NUMth as suggested in earlier comparisons    many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image   while useless  this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files   it is not free in jpeg files  and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts   ghost  edges    do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging    if you are on an x windows system  xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this    cjpeg s default q setting of NUM is appropriate for full color input  but for gif inputs  q settings of NUM to NUM often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation    if you apply smoothing as suggested below  the higher q setting may not be necessary    color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually  dithered  to fool your eye into seeing more than the NUM colors that gif can actually store  if you enlarge the image  you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors  at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value   the trouble with dithering is that  to jpeg  it looks like high spatial frequency color noise  and jpeg can t compress noise very well   the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image  if you had it   to get around this  you want to  smooth  the gif image before compression  smoothing averages together nearby pixels  thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway  and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble   appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor  thus further reducing the size of the compressed file  while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing   with the vNUM free jpeg software  or products based on it   a simple smoothing capability is built in   try   smooth NUM  or so when converting gifs  values of NUM to NUM seem to work well for high quality gifs   heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors    if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement  then strong smoothing is definitely called for    too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image  which you don t want   if you are an image processing wizard  you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program  such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package   however  cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol     the upshot of all this is that  cjpeg  quality NUM  smooth NUM  is probably a good starting point for converting gifs   but if you really care about the image  you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings                           for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular  contact the

they arrogantly declare            that those things cannot be done   such principles of            impotence are common in orthodox modern  science  and help to            cover up inconsistencies

    channels  as described in books like  the path of the            masters   by dr  julian johnson  NUM  and  eckankar  the key            to secret worlds   by sri paul twitchell  NUM   for example             the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the  astral plane    long time members of these groups            have learned to  soul travel  into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there   it seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe  or be created at the

do so because of their            ve ted intere t    the government is needed to intervene   if            the government does not intervene  then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out  prices for energy will increase  and            pollution and its harmful effects  including the  greenhouse            effect   acid rain  smog  radioactive contamination  oil            spills  rape of the land by strip mining  etc   will continue            to increase                             the government should subsidize research and development            of free energy by inventors and universities  subsidize            private production  until the producers can make it on their            own   and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of            free energy hardware                             the long range effects of such government intervention            would be wide spread and profound   the quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer   coal mining            companie   oil companie  and countries  electric utilitie              etc   would drop to near zero  forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere   energy resources  coal  uranium  oil             and gas  would be left in the ground   prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero             while the price of free energy equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases  as happened with vcr s             personal computers  etc     costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease             along with their prices to consumers   consumers would be            able to realize the  opportunity costs  of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel   tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars   government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way   and energy could no longer be            used as a motive or excuse for making war                             many conventional energy producer  would go out of            business  but society as a whole  and the earth s environment            and ecosystems  would benefit greatly   it is the people             that government should serve  rather than the big            corporation  and bank

so called  laws             of thermodynamics are not so  absolute    for example  the            late physicist dewey b  larson developed a comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe  which he            calls the  reciprocal system    which he describes in detail            in several books such as  nothing but motion   NUM  and  the            universe of motion   NUM    in which the physical universe            has two distinct halves  the material half and an anti matter            half  with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing            between them  with out the  heat death  predicted by            thermodynamic  laws    his theory explains the universe much            better than modern orthodox theories  including phenomena            that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about  and is self consistent in every way   some            free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow             seemingly converting  low quality energy  into  high quality            energy                              also  certain religious organizations such as  sant mat             and  eckankar  teach their members that the physical universe            is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of            existence  like parallel universes  or analogous to tv            channels  as described in books like  the path of the            masters   by dr  julian johnson  NUM  and  eckankar  the key            to secret worlds   by sri paul twitchell  NUM   for example             the next level up from the physical universe is commonly            called the  astral plane    long time members of these groups            have learned to  soul travel  into these higher worlds and            report on conditions there   it seems plausible that energy            could flow down from these higher levels into the physical            universe  or be created at the boundary between them  given            the right configuration of matter to channel it   this is            supported by many successful laboratory controlled            experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world  such as            those described in the book  psychic discoveries behind the            iron curtain                              in terms of economics  the market has failed   inventors            do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop            and mass produce free energy equipment  and the conventional            energy producer  have no desire to do so because of their            ve ted intere t    the government is needed to intervene   if            the government does not intervene  then the total supply of            energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and            will soon run out  prices for energy will increase  and            pollution and its harmful effects  including the  greenhouse            effect   acid rain  smog  radioactive contamination  oil            spills  rape of the land by strip mining  etc   will continue            to increase                             the government should subsidize research and development            of free energy by inventors and universities  subsidize            private production  until the producers can make it on their            own   and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of            free energy hardware                             the long range effects of such government intervention            would be wide spread and profound   the quantity of energy            demanded from conventional energy producer   coal mining            companie   oil companie  and countries  electric utilitie              etc   would drop to near zero  forcing their employees to            seek work elsewhere   energy resources  coal  uranium  oil             and gas  would be left in the ground   prices for            conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero             while the price of free energy equipment would start out high            but drop as supply increases  as happened with vcr s             personal computers  etc     costs of producing products that            require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease             along with their prices to consumers   consumers would be            able to realize the  opportunity costs  of paying electric            utility bills or buying home heating fuel   tourism would            benefit and increase because travelers would not have to            spend their money for gasoline for their cars   government            tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be            obtained in some other way   and energy could no longer be            used as a motive or excuse for making war                             many conventional energy producer  would go out of            business  but society as a whole  and the earth s environment            and ecosystems  would benefit greatly   it is the people             that government should serve  rather than the big            corporation  and bank

      "rapture   october NUM  NUM    what to do in case you miss the rapture  i  stay calm and do not panic   your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic   but to do so is absolutely useless now   if you had wanted to get right with god before the rapture  you could have  but you chose to wait   now your  only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the  tribulation    but he that shall endure unto the end  the same shall be  saved     matthew NUM NUM  ii  realize you are now living during the great tribulation   the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until christ s second coming   also know as  the time of jacob s  israel s  trouble   jere NUM NUM  and  daniel s seventieth week   dan NUM   this  period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror   iii  gather as many bibles as you can and hide them   soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community   the revived roman empire   bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason   the bible  however  will be your most valuable  possession during the tribulation   iv  read the bible like you have never read it before in your life   since all of your bibles may be confiscated  even if you are careful  it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them   it is especially important to read daniel  luke NUM  matthew NUM   revelation  and amos  for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you     v  pray like you have never prayed before in your life   pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you   pray and pray  and pray   only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual  strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ     vi  do not take the mark at any cost   even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs   after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community  he will institute a world economic system  designed so that you cannot buy  sell  or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name   money will be useless    and he causes all  both small and great  rich and poor  free and  slave  to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads  and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast   or the number of his name   here is wisdom   let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast  for it is the number of a man  his number is NUM    revelation NUM NUM NUM     the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of  humanity   think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past  such as the holocaust   or maybe the crusades   m  you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist s rule  it will be much worse than anything in history  matt NUM NUM      i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held   and a white robe was given to each of  them  and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer   until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren  who would be killed as they were  was completed   revelation NUM NUM  NUM   his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn      and i saw the souls of  those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of  god  who had not worshiped the beast or his image  and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands     revelation NUM NUM   he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ   nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you  even your children   torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark     if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image  however  you will be consigned to the second death  which is the lake of fire   sung about so eloquently by johnny cash    m  you cannot be redeemed   it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then  sic  to endure eternal torment in the ring h h h h lake of fire       if anyone worships the beast and his image  and receives his  mark on his forehead or on his hand  he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god  which is poured out full strength into the cup of his  indignation   an  sic  he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the  presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb    revelation  NUM NUM NUM    and probably in the presence of season ticket holders  special hats given to the first NUM NUM at the stadium   m    vii  set a plan in motion for survival   although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist s government until the end of the tribulation  all of the time you gain in hiding is  important for your spiritual growth and strengthening  since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake   the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area  for the antichrist s control will come last to the least populated areas   take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay  attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation    as you can see on the weather map  heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak   expect delays on i NUM outbound  and perhaps school closings    m   store water and food  because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark   water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood   get a good water filter    m  bring different types of clothing for all seasons  as well as flashlights  batteries  generators  and first aid supplies   in short  learn how to  survive and live off the land as the pioneers did   viii  trust no one    there will be secret agents everywhere  spying for the antichrist s government   be on the lookout   perot supporters take note   m   ix  watch for the antichrist   it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to  for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it   we can infer from daniel  NUM certain characteristics of this man   popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation  he will dominate the airwaves   he will be  physically appealing  highly intelligent  with christ like charisma and  personality   an international politician  military tactician and economic expert  his word will be peace  he will make a treaty with the jews  which he will break after three and a half years   he will have such supernatural  power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed   even the very elect will be deceived   if you do not pray and read the bible  you too will be deceived   dominate the airwaves   perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh    m   the antichrist will have a companion  the false prohphet  sic   who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak    all who refuse to worhsip  sic  the image will be killed   the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane  with demonized spirits everywhere   x  do not give up hope    the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ   the antichrist will be defeated   be steadfast and endure  and you  will be rewarded greatly in heaven     start reading the bible and praying fervently now   the salvation of  your sould depends upon it   determine that  come what may  you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist   you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved  but this time you will have to be  faithful unto death

      "brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter  or we must discount every other book of antiquity    mr ceccarelli  you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every  historical  document   somehow i doubt do that yourself that   thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document  i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter    i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity  which i am sure you reject  it dates from the time of ramses ii  this was first presented here by matthew wiener    these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle  and were carved with the pharoah s specific approval so we have true originals  rather than mere copies   this account records the the battle of kadesh  circa NUM bc   which occurred on the river orontes   about NUM miles south of aleppo    the egyptians won this battle with the hittites  and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place   a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form   it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single handedly defeated the hittites  after being separated from his troops    note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person   the following is from miriam lichtheim s _ancient egyptian literature_ volume ii    my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall  on their faces  one upon the other  as crocodiles fall  into  the water of the orontes   i was after them like a griffin   i attacked all the countries  i alone   for my infantry and  my chariotry had deserted me  not one of them stood looking  back   as i live  as ra loves me  as my father atum favors  me  everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth   in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry    note  this paragraph records not only ramses  divine word   but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event   now from the heart of  battle     then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces  of the foe from hitti  being alone by himself  none other  with him   his majesty proceeded to look about him and  found NUM chariots ringing him on his way out       no officer was with me  no charioteer   no soldier of the army  no shield bearer   my infantry  my chariotry yielded before them   not one of them stood firm to fight with them   his majesty spoke   what is this  father amun   is it right for a father to ignore his son   are my deeds a matter for you to ignore   do i not walk and stand at your word   i have not neglected an order you gave   too great is he  the great lord of egypt   to allow aliens to step on his path   what are these asiatics to you  o amun   the wretches ignorant of god   have i not made for you many great monuments        i call to you  my father amun   i am among a host of strangers   all countries are arrayed against me   i am alone  there s none with me        the labors of many people are nothing   amun is more helpful than they   i came here by the command of your mouth   o amun  i have not transgressed your command     now though i prayed in a distant land   my voice resounded in southern thebes   i found amun came when i called to him   he gave me his hand and i rejoiced   he called from behind as if near by    forward  i am with you   i your father  my hand is with you   i prevail over a hundred thousand men   i am lord of victory  lover of valor    i found my heart stout  my breast in joy   all i did succeeded  i was like mont        i slaughtered among them at my will   not one looked behind him   not one turned around   whoever fell down did not

      "brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter  or we must discount every other book of antiquity    mr ceccarelli  you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything written in every  historical  document   somehow i doubt do that yourself that   thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical document  i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith in the words of the books attributed to peter    i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity  which i am sure you reject  it dates from the time of ramses ii  this was first presented here by matthew wiener    these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle  and were carved with the pharoah s specific approval so we have true originals  rather than mere copies   this account records the the battle of kadesh  circa NUM bc   which occurred on the river orontes   about NUM miles south of aleppo    the egyptians won this battle with the hittites  and ramses had his victory inscribed all over the place   a few of of these inscriptions have survived in near perfect form   it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much single handedly defeated the hittites  after being separated from his troops    note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person   the following is from miriam lichtheim s _ancient egyptian literature_ volume ii    my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall  on their faces  one upon the other  as crocodiles fall  into  the water of the orontes   i was after them like a griffin   i attacked all the countries  i alone   for my infantry and  my chariotry had deserted me  not one of them stood looking  back   as i live  as ra loves me  as my father atum favors  me  everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth   in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry    note  this paragraph records not only ramses  divine word   but also that there were thousands of witnesses to the event   now from the heart of  battle     then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces  of the foe from hitti  being alone by himself  none other  with him   his majesty proceeded to look about him and  found NUM chariots ringing him on his way out       no officer was with me  no charioteer   no soldier of the army  no shield bearer   my infantry  my chariotry yielded before them   not one of them stood firm to fight with them   his majesty spoke   what is this  father amun   is it right for a father to ignore his son   are my deeds a matter for you to ignore   do i not walk and stand at your word   i have not neglected an order you gave   too great is he  the great lord of egypt   to allow aliens to step on his path   what are these asiatics to you  o amun   the wretches ignorant of god   have i not made for you many great monuments        i call to you  my father amun   i am among a host of strangers   all countries are arrayed against me   i am alone  there s none with me        the labors of many people are nothing   amun is more helpful than they   i came here by the command of your mouth   o amun  i have not transgressed your command     now though i prayed in a distant land   my voice resounded in southern thebes   i found amun came when i called to him   he gave me his hand and i rejoiced   he called from behind as if near by    forward  i am with you   i your father  my hand is with you   i prevail over a hundred thousand men   i am lord of victory  lover of valor    i found my heart stout  my breast in joy   all i did succeeded  i was like mont        i slaughtered among them at my will   not one looked behind him   not one turned around   whoever fell down did not rise        one called out to the other saying    no man is he who is among us   it is seth great of strength  baal in person   not deeds of man are these his doings   they are of one who is unique   who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots   come quick  flee before him   to seek life and breathe air   for he who attempts to get close to him   his hands  all his limbs grow limp

publishing company melbourne  florida  usa orig  ed  NUM pre publication  NUM NUM isbn NUM NUM NUM NUM   this text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon   the idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century   the need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years   as soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one  human beings wanted to reach them      tracing the history of the many imaginative  and often prescient  attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology  science  astronomy  and engineering   once space travel became feasible  there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board   or off the ground  for that matter   these also are described in theis book  for the same reason as the pre space age and pre flight ideas are   they are all accurate reflections of their particular era s dreams  abilities  and knowledge   virtually every spaceship concept invented since NUM  as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel  is listed chronologically   the chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures   they also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries   they reveal connections  influences  and evolutions hitherto unsuspected   every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration   nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing   this allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss  to visualize differences  similarities  and influences   this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history  and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams    science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating   the unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship   special features  includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft  both real and fictional  contains scores of illustrations  artwork  drawings  and photos contemporary with the subject   this includes

      "ron miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career    i ve admired both his paintings  remember the usps solar system exploration stamps last year   and his writings on the history of spaceflight   for several years he s been working on a  big  project which is almost ready to hit the streets   a brochure from his publisher has landed in my mailbox  and i thought it was cool enough to type in part of it  it s rather long    especially given the net s strong interest in vaporware spacecraft                                                                                   the dream machines  an illustrated history of the spaceship in art  science  and literature                              by ron miller                   with foreword by arthur c  clarke  krieger publishing company melbourne  florida  usa orig  ed  NUM pre publication  NUM NUM isbn NUM NUM NUM NUM   this text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a technological phenomenon   the idea of a vehicle for traversing the space betwen worlds did not spring full blown into existence in the tlatter half of theis century   the need preceded the ability ot make such a device by several hundred years   as soon as it was realized that there were other worlds than this one  human beings wanted to reach them      tracing the history of the many imaginative  and often prescient  attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of technology  science  astronomy  and engineering   once space travel became feasible  there were many more spacecraft concepts developed than ever got off the drawing board   or off the ground  for that matter   these also are described in theis book  for the same reason as the pre space age and pre flight ideas are   they are all accurate reflections of their particular era s dreams  abilities  and knowledge   virtually every spaceship concept invented since NUM  as well as selected events important in developing the idea of extraterrestrial travel  is listed chronologically   the chronological entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and speculative ventures   they also allow comparisons between simultaneous events taking place in different countries   they reveal connections  influences  and evolutions hitherto unsuspected   every entry is accompanied by at least one illustration   nearly every spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing   this allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss  to visualize differences  similarities  and influences   this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history  and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic diagrams    science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating   the unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and very interesting history of the spaceship   special features  includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft  both real and fictional  contains scores of illustrations  artwork  drawings  and photos contemporary with the subject   this includes

      "think about what you are saying here  the NUM bit image is quantised down to NUM bits so many  similar  colours are mapped onto a single palette colour  this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways  you then want to apply these modifications back to the NUM bit file  so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  ok you could do this by copying the NUM bit file to a NUM bit file and using the extra NUM bits to hold the index entry   having done this  you need to do something to them     what  exactly   apply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group  this could generate colours with rgb outside the range NUM   NUM  it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries   you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry  however i suspect this would look rather odd   so in summary  what i said in my previous posting still holds     in other words  to edit a NUM bit file you need software built for the job  tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves   as to the other bits   you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in xv  if that was not what you meant  then    yes  i probably did  i found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was  sorry if i misunderstood    yes again  what  is   was   wrong with xv      chris lilley                                                                              technical author  itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit  manchester computing centre  oxford road   manchester  uk   mNUM NUMpl                        internet  c c lilley mcc ac uk  voice   NUM  NUM NUM NUM NUM  fax   NUM  NUM NUM NUM NUM janet  c c lilley uk ac mcc\n"

      "think about what you are saying here  the NUM bit image is quantised down to NUM bits so many  similar  colours are mapped onto a single palette colour  this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways  you then want to apply these modifications back to the NUM bit file  so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour  ok you could do this by copying the NUM bit file to a NUM bit file and using the extra NUM bits to hold the index entry   having done this  you need to do something to them     what  exactly   apply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to each colour in the group  this could generate colours with rgb outside the range NUM   NUM  it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries   you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how far each colour was from the palette entry  however i suspect this would look rather odd   so in summary  what i said in my previous posting still holds     in other words  to edit a NUM bit file you need software built for the job  tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves   as to the other bits   you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in xv  if that was not what you meant  then    yes  i probably did  i found that the collected digest format of your posting made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was  sorry if i misunderstood    yes again  what  is   was   wrong with xv      chris lilley                                                                              technical author  itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit  manchester computing centre  oxford road   manchester  uk   mNUM NUMpl                        internet  c c lilley mcc ac uk  voice   NUM  NUM NUM NUM NUM  fax   NUM  NUM NUM NUM NUM janet  c c lilley uk ac mcc\n",

      " rick  i think we can safely say  NUM  robert is not the only person who understands the bible  and NUM   the leadership of the lds church historicly never has   let s consider some  personal interpretations  and see how much trust we should put in  orthodox mormonism   which could never be confused with orthodox christianity           in one of his attacks on christians  the mormon apostle bruce r  mcconkie said they  thrash around in   darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah   he also said christians are wrong to believe  that jehovah is the supreme deity  god the father    and that christ  came into mortality  as his  only begotten  son  mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter  he said that  elohim is the father  and  jehovah is the son       being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their three in one god  it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised messiah  some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the   supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten  as   with their concept that god is a spirit  this misinformation about the   gods of heaven is untrue  the fact is  and it too is attested by holy   writ  that elohim is the father  and that jehovah is the son who was   born into mortality as the lord jesus christ  the promised messiah     promised messiah  p  NUM           notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their  three in one god  and their belief that  god is a spirit  as they are in their understanding of who  elohim  and  jehovah  are  before examining mcconkie s attack and its validity  we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words  elohim  and  jehovah   mcconkie stated         the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in   the old testament  as that ancient work is now published  is the   exalted name title jehovah   promised messiah  p  NUM      _elohim_  plural word though it is  is also used as the exalted   name title of god the eternal father  a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence  he being god above all gods   mormon   doctrine  p  NUM           agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who  elohim  and  jehovah  are  the apostle james e  talmage stated      _elohim_  as understood and used in the restored church of jesus   christ  is the name title of god the eternal father  whose firstborn   son in the spirit is _jehovah_    the only begotten in the flesh    jesus christ   jesus the christ  p  NUM            a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve  apostles of the mormon church states that  god the eternal father    is  designate d  by the exalted name title  elohim       articles of faith  p  NUM      christ in his preexistent  antemortal  or unembodied state   was known as jehovah      articles of faith  p  NUM           today mormon leaders teach that  elohim  in the ot refers to god the father and  jehovah  refers to christ  mcconkie attacked christians for saying  jehovah  can refer to the father  he stressed that these two  name titles  should not be changed around so that christ is called  elohim  and the father is called  jehovah       the father   is elohim  not jehovah     jehovah is christ  and christ is jehovah  they are one and the same person    promised messiah  p  NUM           in the ot of the kjv of the bible  the hebrew word  elohim  is used to refer to the true god  false gods and goddesses  and the judges of israel  when referring to the true god   elohim  is translated with a capital  g   when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel  it is translated with a small  g   it is translated four times as  judges   exod  NUM NUM  NUM NUM NUM   once as  judge   NUM sam  NUM NUM   twice as  mighty   gen  NUM NUM  exod  NUM NUM   once as  angels   ps  NUM NUM   once as  godly   mal  NUM NUM   once as  great   gen  NUM NUM   and once as  very great    NUM sam  NUM NUM           the word  jehovah  is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word  adonai    many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh  however  since  jehovah  rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism  this section will also use  jehovah  instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name   jehovah   unlike  elohim   is never used of false gods  it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible  in the kjv   jehovah  is rendered primarily  lord   sometimes  god   and rarely  lord            now that we understand something about the words  elohim  and  jehovah  and their use by mormon leaders  we shall consider the apostle mcconkie s attack on christians for believing the father is  jehovah   in trying to prove that  jehovah  refers exclusively to christ  mcconkie cited several verses from the bible  some of these verses and mcconkie s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right  remember  mcconkie said the father is not  jehovah   he is only  elohim   the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie s interpretation of ps  NUM NUM  of this verse he stated      of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit   and he testified   the lord said unto my lord  sit thou at my right   hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool    ps  NUM NUM   two   lords are here involved  one is speaking to the other  one is greater   than the other  one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other  who are they and what message is contained in this   messianic prophecy     what think ye of christ   our lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry   whose son is he   is christ   the son of god or of someone else  is he to be born of a divine parent   or will he be as other men    a mortal son of a mortal father  that he   was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the   jews  and so they answered   the son of david     david s son  truly he was  but he was more  much more  and so our   lord  with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture    asked   how then doth david in spirit call him lord  saying  the lord   said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine   enemies thy footstool  if david then call him lord  how is he his   son   that is  if he is only the son of david  how is it that the   great king  acting under inspiration  calls him lord and worships him   as such  and we might add  _who is the other lord  the one who spake   unto david s lord _ can there be any question as to how jesus is   interpreting the words of the psalm  he is saying that it means   _the   father said unto the son  elohim said unto jehovah_  sit thou on my   right hand  until after your mortal ministry  then i will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me  where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever    promised messiah  pp  NUM NUM     emphasis added           agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie  the following remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormons think of christ  p  NUM reads   the lord  elohim  the father  said unto my lord  jehovah  the son       brackets in original           mcconkie clearly stated that it is  elohim  the father who is speaking to  jehovah  the son in this psalm  however  when one looks at the hebrew word translated  lord   it becomes apparent that either the first  lord  is not the father or else the father is  jehovah   either way mcconkie is wrong  the psalm reads      the lord  jehovah  said unto my lord  adon   sit thou at my right   hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool   ps  NUM NUM           the first  lord  in this verse is  jehovah  who mormonism says is christ  not the father  the second  lord  is the hebrew word  adon   singular for  adonai   meaning master or lord   if the first  lord  is the father and the second  lord  is the son  then the father is  jehovah  and the son is  adon   however  if the father is not  jehovah  as mcconkie claimed  then the first  lord  is  jehovah  the son  but who  then  is  adon   obviously the father is  jehovah  in this psalm  and his son is  adon            another example involves isa  NUM NUM about which mcconkie stated the following      i the lord have called thee in righteousness   _isaiah quoted the   father as saying of christ_   and will hold thine hand  and will keep   thee  and give thee for a covenant of the people  for a light of the   gentiles    isa  NUM NUM    promised messiah  p  NUM   emphasis added           mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads      i the lord  jehovah  have called thee in righteousness  and will hold   thine hand  and will keep thee  and give thee for a covenant of the   people  for a light of the gentiles   isa  NUM NUM           according to mcconkie   i the lord  refers to the father  and  thine  and  thee  refer to christ  however  the  lord  who is speaking is  jehovah  which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is  jehovah            another example involves ps  NUM NUM NUM  of these verses mcconkie stated     shoot out the lip  they shake the head  saying  he trusted on the lord   that he would deliver him  let him deliver him  seeing he delighted in   him    ps  NUM NUM NUM   _the fulfillment  as jesus hung on the cross_  is   found in these words   the chief priests mocking him  with the scribes   and elders  said  he saved others  himself he cannot save  if he be   the king of israel  let him now come down from the cross  and we will   believe him  he trusted in god  let him deliver him now  if he will   have him  for he said  i am the son of god  the thieves also  which   were crucified with him  cast the same in his teeth    matt    NUM NUM NUM    promised messiah  pp  NUM NUM   emphasis added           ps  NUM NUM NUM reads as follows      all they that see me laugh me to scorn  they shoot out the lip  they   shake the head  saying  he trusted on the lord  jehovah  that he would   deliver him  let him deliver him  seeing he delighted in him           mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment  as jesus hung on the cross   that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ  who  then  was the  lord  in whom he trusted  it was  jehovah  the father           another example involves ps  NUM NUM and ps  NUM NUM  regarding them  mcconkie stated the following      with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   lord s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was   they took counsel   together against me  they devised to take away my life    ps  NUM NUM      mine own familiar friend  in whom i trusted  which did eat of my   bread  hath lifted up his heel against me    ps  NUM NUM    promised   messiah  p  NUM           apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ s  arrest and judicial trials   we shall first consider ps  NUM and then ps  NUM  while mcconkie only quoted verse NUM of ps  NUM  verse NUM will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter      for i have heard the slander of many  fear was on every side  while   they took counsel together against me  they devised to take away my   life  but i trusted in thee  o lord  jehovah   i said  thou art my god    elohim    ps  NUM NUM NUM           mcconkie said verse NUM referred to jesus christ  verse NUM goes on to tell that he  christ  trusted in the  lord  who is called his  god  or  elohim   mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is  elohim  the father  verse NUM  however  reveals that the  elohim  of the man jesus is  jehovah  the father           in ps  NUM  mcconkie only quoted one verse  however  two verses will be considered in this examination      yea  mine own familiar friend  in whom i trusted  which did eat of my   bread  hath lifted up his heel against me    but thou  o lord  jehovah   be merciful unto me  and raise me up  that   i may requite them   ps  NUM NUM NUM           mcconkie stated above that verse NUM referred to judas  role in christ s death  since it was judas who was the  familiar friend  who  lifted up his heel   the pronouns  mine    i    my   and  me  in verse NUM must refer to christ  notice that at the beginning of verse NUM there is a change of pronoun to  thou   which refers to the  lord   jehovah   then the pronouns  me  and  i  which refer to christ are used again  that means christ was speaking to  jehovah  the father in these verses           another example involves mcconkie s following remark about ps          NUM NUM      one of the great messianic prophecies  spoken by the mouth of david    ever after the order of melchizedek    ps  NUM NUM    promised messiah    p  NUM           mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ  the question is  what in this verse refers to christ      the lord  jehovah  hath sworn  and will not repent  thou art a priest   for ever after the order of melchizedek   ps  NUM NUM           does the  lord   which is  jehovah   refer to christ  if mcconkie is right and jesus is  jehovah   but the father is not  then the  lord  would have to refer to christ  but who  then  is the one addressed as the  priest forever after the order of melchizedek   the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ  heb  NUM NUM NUM  NUM NUM  NUM   therefore  the  lord   jehovah  in ps  NUM NUM is the father           another example involves isa  NUM NUM NUM  of these verses mcconkie stated      of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah  isaiah said         the _lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all          it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him     promised messiah  p  NUM        emphasis added           mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to  the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah   however  what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is  jehovah   verse NUM reads   all we like sheep have gone astray  we have turned every one to his own way  and the lord  jehovah  hath laid on him  christ  the iniquity of us all   and verse NUM reads   yet it pleased the lord  jehovah  to bruise him  christ               obviously the  lord  who laid on christ  the iniquity of us all  and who bruised him is god the father who is called  jehovah  in these verses           remember  mcconkie stated that  some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity   and that christ  came into mortality  as his  only begotten  son  he called this concept  misinformation  that is  untrue   to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth  two scriptural references  NUM sam  NUM NUM  ps  NUM NUM  will be examined  mcconkie stated the following regarding these scriptures      in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic  the lord says of   the seed of david   i will be his father  and he shall be my son    NUM   sam  NUM NUM   in the second psalm  the whole of which is also clearly   messianic  occurs this statement   thou art my son  this day have i   begotten thee    ps  NUM NUM   paul quotes both of these statements in   hebrews NUM NUM and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the   son of god   promised messiah  p  NUM           mcconkie cited heb  NUM NUM to show that NUM sam  NUM NUM and ps  NUM NUM refer to christ who  would come as the son of god   since mcconkie first referenced NUM sam  NUM NUM  this examination will  too  however  along with verse NUM  verses NUM NUM will also be included      and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people   israel  and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies  also the   lord  jehovah  telleth thee that he will make thee an house    and when thy days be fulfilled  and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers    i will set up thy seed after thee  which shall proceed out of thy   bowels  and i will establish his kingdom    he shall build an house for my name  and i will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever  i will be his father  and he shall be my son   NUM   sam  NUM NUM NUM           these verses teach that the  lord   jehovah  would have a son  the messiah          in the second example mcconkie cited ps  NUM NUM  this examination will include verse NUM  notice that it is the  lord   jehovah  who says   thou art my son  this day have i begotten thee       i will declare the decree  the lord  jehovah  hath said unto me  thou   art my son  this day have i begotten thee    ask of me  and i shall give thee

verse says the  lord   jehovah  did the anointing  again  we face the same problem  if  jehovah  does not refer to the father  but only to christ  then jesus anointed someone  but who  as mcconkie pointed out   jesus applied these passages to himself   therefore  the  jehovah  who anointed christ is god the father           other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon

sight of the lord  jehovah             although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father  jehovah  sent his son into the world  these beliefs are true  god is triune  he is spirit  he is  jehovah   and he did send his son into the world to redeem mankind           it is obvious from this examination that it is not the christians who  thrash around in   darkness  about who  elohim  and  jehovah  are  one wonders what  holy writ  mcconkie had in mind when he stated that it attests to the fact that  elohim is the

      " rick  i think we can safely say  NUM  robert is not the only person who understands the bible  and NUM   the leadership of the lds church historicly never has   let s consider some  personal interpretations  and see how much trust we should put in  orthodox mormonism   which could never be confused with orthodox christianity           in one of his attacks on christians  the mormon apostle bruce r  mcconkie said they  thrash around in   darkness in trying to identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised messiah   he also said christians are wrong to believe  that jehovah is the supreme deity  god the father    and that christ  came into mortality  as his  only begotten  son  mcconkie then stated what mormons believe today to be the truth about the matter  he said that  elohim is the father  and  jehovah is the son       being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists   have gone in defining their three in one god  it comes as no surprise   to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to   identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the   promised messiah  some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the   supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten  as   with their concept that god is a spirit  this misinformation about the   gods of heaven is untrue  the fact is  and it too is attested by holy   writ  that elohim is the father  and that jehovah is the son who was   born into mortality as the lord jesus christ  the promised messiah     promised messiah  p  NUM           notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about their  three in one god  and their belief that  god is a spirit  as they are in their understanding of who  elohim  and  jehovah  are  before examining mcconkie s attack and its validity  we shall read a few more statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words  elohim  and  jehovah   mcconkie stated         the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in   the old testament  as that ancient work is now published  is the   exalted name title jehovah   promised messiah  p  NUM      _elohim_  plural word though it is  is also used as the exalted   name title of god the eternal father  a usage that connotes his   supremacy and omnipotence  he being god above all gods   mormon   doctrine  p  NUM           agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who  elohim  and  jehovah  are  the apostle james e  talmage stated      _elohim_  as understood and used in the restored church of jesus   christ  is the name title of god the eternal father  whose firstborn   son in the spirit is _jehovah_    the only begotten in the flesh    jesus christ   jesus the christ  p  NUM            a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve  apostles of the mormon church states that  god the eternal father    is  designate d  by the exalted name title  elohim       articles of faith  p  NUM      christ in his preexistent  antemortal  or unembodied state   was known as jehovah      articles of faith  p  NUM           today mormon leaders teach that  elohim  in the ot refers to god the father and  jehovah  refers to christ  mcconkie attacked christians for saying  jehovah  can refer to the father  he stressed that these two  name titles  should not be changed around so that christ is called  elohim  and the father is called  jehovah       the father   is elohim  not jehovah     jehovah is christ  and christ is jehovah  they are one and the same person    promised messiah  p  NUM           in the ot of the kjv of the bible  the hebrew word  elohim  is used to refer to the true god  false gods and goddesses  and the judges of israel  when referring to the true god   elohim  is translated with a capital  g   when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges of israel  it is translated with a small  g   it is translated four times as  judges   exod  NUM NUM  NUM NUM NUM   once as  judge   NUM sam  NUM NUM   twice as  mighty   gen  NUM NUM  exod  NUM NUM   once as  angels   ps  NUM NUM   once as  godly   mal  NUM NUM   once as  great   gen  NUM NUM   and once as  very great    NUM sam  NUM NUM           the word  jehovah  is the traditional pronunciation of the tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word  adonai    many people believe the true pronunciation of the tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh  however  since  jehovah  rather than yahweh is the word used by mormonism  this section will also use  jehovah  instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of mormon leaders regarding that name   jehovah   unlike  elohim   is never used of false gods  it is the personal name of the triune god of the bible  in the kjv   jehovah  is rendered primarily  lord   sometimes  god   and rarely  lord            now that we understand something about the words  elohim  and  jehovah  and their use by mormon leaders  we shall consider the apostle mcconkie s attack on christians for believing the father is  jehovah   in trying to prove that  jehovah  refers exclusively to christ  mcconkie cited several verses from the bible  some of these verses and mcconkie s interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right  remember  mcconkie said the father is not  jehovah   he is only  elohim   the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie s interpretation of ps  NUM NUM  of this verse he stated      of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit   and he testified   the lord said unto my lord  sit thou at my right   hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool    ps  NUM NUM   two   lords are here involved  one is speaking to the other  one is greater   than the other  one is making provision for the triumph and glory of   the other  who are they and what message is contained in this   messianic prophecy     what think ye of christ   our lord asked certain of his detractors   toward the end of his mortal ministry   whose son is he   is christ   the son of god or of someone else  is he to be born of a divine parent   or will he be as other men    a mortal son of a mortal father  that he   was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the   jews  and so they answered   the son of david     david s son  truly he was  but he was more  much more  and so our   lord  with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture    asked   how then doth david in spirit call him lord  saying  the lord   said unto my lord  sit thou on my right hand  till i make thine   enemies thy footstool  if david then call him lord  how is he his   son   that is  if he is only the son of david  how is it that the   great king  acting under inspiration  calls him lord and worships him   as such  and we might add  _who is the other lord  the one who spake   unto david s lord _ can there be any question as to how jesus is   interpreting the words of the psalm  he is saying that it means   _the   father said unto the son  elohim said unto jehovah_  sit thou on my   right hand  until after your mortal ministry  then i will raise you up   to eternal glory and exaltation with me  where you will continue to   sit on my right hand forever    promised messiah  pp  NUM NUM     emphasis added           agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie  the following remark in the mormon pamphlet _what the mormons think of christ  p  NUM reads   the lord  elohim  the father  said unto my lord  jehovah  the son       brackets in original           mcconkie clearly stated that it is  elohim  the father who is speaking to  jehovah  the son in this psalm  however  when one looks at the hebrew word translated  lord   it becomes apparent that either the first  lord  is not the father or else the father is  jehovah   either way mcconkie is wrong  the psalm reads      the lord  jehovah  said unto my lord  adon   sit thou at my right   hand  until i make thine enemies thy footstool   ps  NUM NUM           the first  lord  in this verse is  jehovah  who mormonism says is christ  not the father  the second  lord  is the hebrew word  adon   singular for  adonai   meaning master or lord   if the first  lord  is the father and the second  lord  is the son  then the father is  jehovah  and the son is  adon   however  if the father is not  jehovah  as mcconkie claimed  then the first  lord  is  jehovah  the son  but who  then  is  adon   obviously the father is  jehovah  in this psalm  and his son is  adon            another example involves isa  NUM NUM about which mcconkie stated the following      i the lord have called thee in righteousness   _isaiah quoted the   father as saying of christ_   and will hold thine hand  and will keep   thee  and give thee for a covenant of the people  for a light of the   gentiles    isa  NUM NUM    promised messiah  p  NUM   emphasis added           mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage which reads      i the lord  jehovah  have called thee in righteousness  and will hold   thine hand  and will keep thee  and give thee for a covenant of the   people  for a light of the gentiles   isa  NUM NUM           according to mcconkie   i the lord  refers to the father  and  thine  and  thee  refer to christ  however  the  lord  who is speaking is  jehovah  which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking or else the father is  jehovah            another example involves ps  NUM NUM NUM  of these verses mcconkie stated     shoot out the lip  they shake the head  saying  he trusted on the lord   that he would deliver him  let him deliver him  seeing he delighted in   him    ps  NUM NUM NUM   _the fulfillment  as jesus hung on the cross_  is   found in these words   the chief priests mocking him  with the scribes   and elders  said  he saved others  himself he cannot save  if he be   the king of israel  let him now come down from the cross  and we will   believe him  he trusted in god  let him deliver him now  if he will   have him  for he said  i am the son of god  the thieves also  which   were crucified with him  cast the same in his teeth    matt    NUM NUM NUM    promised messiah  pp  NUM NUM   emphasis added           ps  NUM NUM NUM reads as follows      all they that see me laugh me to scorn  they shoot out the lip  they   shake the head  saying  he trusted on the lord  jehovah  that he would   deliver him  let him deliver him  seeing he delighted in him           mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment  as jesus hung on the cross   that means the person who was scorned in these verses was christ  who  then  was the  lord  in whom he trusted  it was  jehovah  the father           another example involves ps  NUM NUM and ps  NUM NUM  regarding them  mcconkie stated the following      with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our   lord s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was   they took counsel   together against me  they devised to take away my life    ps  NUM NUM      mine own familiar friend  in whom i trusted  which did eat of my   bread  hath lifted up his heel against me    ps  NUM NUM    promised   messiah  p  NUM           apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ s  arrest and judicial trials   we shall first consider ps  NUM and then ps  NUM  while mcconkie only quoted verse NUM of ps  NUM  verse NUM will also be included to give a complete understanding of the matter      for i have heard the slander of many  fear was on every side  while   they took counsel together against me  they devised to take away my   life  but i trusted in thee  o lord  jehovah   i said  thou art my god    elohim    ps  NUM NUM NUM           mcconkie said verse NUM referred to jesus christ  verse NUM goes on to tell that he  christ  trusted in the  lord  who is called his  god  or  elohim   mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is  elohim  the father  verse NUM  however  reveals that the  elohim  of the man jesus is  jehovah  the father           in ps  NUM  mcconkie only quoted one verse  however  two verses will be considered in this examination      yea  mine own familiar friend  in whom i trusted  which did eat of my   bread  hath lifted up his heel against me    but thou  o lord  jehovah   be merciful unto me  and raise me up  that   i may requite them   ps  NUM NUM NUM           mcconkie stated above that verse NUM referred to judas  role in christ s death  since it was judas who was the  familiar friend  who  lifted up his heel   the pronouns  mine    i    my   and  me  in verse NUM must refer to christ  notice that at the beginning of verse NUM there is a change of pronoun to  thou   which refers to the  lord   jehovah   then the pronouns  me  and  i  which refer to christ are used again  that means christ was speaking to  jehovah  the father in these verses           another example involves mcconkie s following remark about ps          NUM NUM      one of the great messianic prophecies  spoken by the mouth of david    ever after the order of melchizedek    ps  NUM NUM    promised messiah    p  NUM           mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ  the question is  what in this verse refers to christ      the lord  jehovah  hath sworn  and will not repent  thou art a priest   for ever after the order of melchizedek   ps  NUM NUM           does the  lord   which is  jehovah   refer to christ  if mcconkie is right and jesus is  jehovah   but the father is not  then the  lord  would have to refer to christ  but who  then  is the one addressed as the  priest forever after the order of melchizedek   the bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ  heb  NUM NUM NUM  NUM NUM  NUM   therefore  the  lord   jehovah  in ps  NUM NUM is the father           another example involves isa  NUM NUM NUM  of these verses mcconkie stated      of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah  isaiah said         the _lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all          it pleased the _lord_ to bruise him     promised messiah  p  NUM        emphasis added           mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to  the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah   however  what he failed to mention is that they also prove that the father is  jehovah   verse NUM reads   all we like sheep have gone astray  we have turned every one to his own way  and the lord  jehovah  hath laid on him  christ  the iniquity of us all   and verse NUM reads   yet it pleased the lord  jehovah  to bruise him  christ               obviously the  lord  who laid on christ  the iniquity of us all  and who bruised him is god the father who is called  jehovah  in these verses           remember  mcconkie stated that  some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the supreme deity   and that christ  came into mortality  as his  only begotten  son  he called this concept  misinformation  that is  untrue   to prove that it is mcconkie who is misinformed and believing untruth  two scriptural references  NUM sam  NUM NUM  ps  NUM NUM  will be examined  mcconkie stated the

shall build an house for my name  and i will stablish the throne of   his kingdom for ever  i will be his father  and he shall be my son   NUM   sam  NUM NUM NUM           these verses teach that the  lord   jehovah  would have a son  the messiah          in the second example mcconkie cited ps  NUM NUM  this examination will include verse NUM  notice that it is the  lord   jehovah  who says   thou

the heathen for thine inheritance    and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession           mcconkie said these verses of scripture are  clearly messianic   and he acknowledged they teach that  christ would come as the son of god   what he is not willing to acknowledge  however  is that these scriptures also teach that the father is  jehovah  and that the  sectarians  who believe  jehovah is the supreme deity whose son  is jesus christ   the only begotten   are right in their belief           another example involves mic  NUM NUM  of this verse mcconkie stated the following      and so  truly  did our lord act _during his mortal ministry  truly    this is he of whom it is written_   he shall stand and feed in the   strength of the lord  in the majesty of the name of the lord

lord  and   his   anointed   ps  NUM NUM   signifying that the chosen one was consecrated   and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his  _jesus   applied these passages to himself_ by

promised messiah  pp  NUM NUM   emphasis added           the first source mcconkie quoted    ps  NUM NUM    reads as follows      the kings of the earth set themselves  and the rulers take counsel   together  against the lord  jehovah   and against his anointed           mcconkie said the  anointed  one was christ  if that is true  who was  jehovah   if  jehovah  is always christ  who was the  anointed  one  obviously  jehovah  is referring to god the father and the  anointed  is indeed referring to christ  the second source mcconkie cited is isa  NUM NUM which states      the spirit of the lord  adonai  god  jehovah  is upon me  because the   lord  jehovah  hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek    he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted  to proclaim liberty to   the captives  and the opening of the prison to them that are bound           the one who was anointed to preach  bind up  proclaim  and open was jesus christ  who  then  was the one who anointed him  this verse says the  lord   jehovah  did the anointing  again  we face the same problem  if  jehovah  does not refer to the father  but only to christ  then jesus anointed someone  but who  as mcconkie pointed out   jesus applied these passages to himself   therefore  the  jehovah  who anointed christ is god the father           other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not  jehovah   however  these should be enough to expose their error           now  what about mormonism s claim that jesus is  jehovah   but he is not  elohim   it is true that jesus is  jehovah   the following scriptures prove this fact      thus saith the lord  jehovah  the king of israel  and his redeemer   the lord  jehovah  of hosts  i am

      " in article  NUMrNUMtqo ook horus ap mchp sni de              theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes  irrational          belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism          deletion           theism is correlated with fanaticism  i have neither said that all fanatism      is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism  the point is       theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic  one could of course      argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism  for example   but i just      have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology      to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it           imo  the influence of stalin  or for that matter  ayn rand  invalidates your     assumption that theism is the factor to be considered         bogus  i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism     the point is that theism is  a  factor       that s your claim  now back it up   i consider your argument as useful   as the following   belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism   therefore   belief is  a  factor in fanaticism   true  and utterly useless    note  this   is  any  belief  not belief in gods         tiring to say the least  i have backed it up  read the first statement   i have read it   conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point       the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy  saying someone believes  something is hardly an information about the person at all  saying someone  is a theist holds much more information  further  the correlation between  theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism  because of the special features of theistic belief   truth by blatant assertion   evidence            gullibility      blind obedience to authority  lack of scepticism  and so on  are all more     reliable indicators   and the really dangerous people   the sources of     fanaticism   are often none of these things   they are cynical manipulators     of the gullible  who know precisely what they are doing         that s a claim you have to support  please note that especially in the    field of theism  the leaders believe what they say       if you believe that  you re incredibly naive         you  frank o dwyer  are living in a dream world  i wonder if there is any  base of discussion left after such a statement  as a matter of fact  i think  you are ignorant of human nature  even when one starts with something one does  not believe  one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says      to give you the benefit of the doubt  prove your statement   the onus of proof is on you  sunshine   what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say   especially when they say one thing and do another  or say one thing closely followed by its opposite   the practice is not restricted to theism  but it s there for anyone to see   it s almost an epidemic in this country   just for instance  if it is harder for a camel to pass thru  the eye of a needle  why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner   why are there churches to the square inch in my country         now   some      brands of theism  and more precisely  some  theists  do tend to fanaticism      i grant you   to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry  not a reasoned     argument   and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction     of religious freedom   ever read animal farm          that s a straw man  and as usually in discussions with you one has to    repeat it  read what i have written above  not every theism leads to    fanatism  and not all fanatism is caused by theism  the point is     there is a correlation  and it comes from innate features of theism       no  some of it comes from features which  some  theism has in common   with  some  fanaticism     your last statement simply isn t implied by   what you say before  because you re trying to sneak in  innate features   of  all  theism    the word you re groping for is  some          bogus again  not all theism as is is fanatic  however  the rest already  gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and  theism  and further  the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them  to switch to fanatism easily  it takes just a nifty improvement in the  theology   truth by blatant assertion             gullibility  by the way  is one of them       no shit  sherlock   so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism    since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have  as opposed   to the case you are trying to make         because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people  causing the correlation  and the whole discussion started that way by the  statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism  which you  challenged   indeed i did   as i recall  i asked for evidence   what is the correlation of which you speak             and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw    men  interesting that you have nothing better to offer       i said it reads like a warm up to that   that s because it s an irrational   and bogus tirade  and has no other use than creating a nice them us   split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either   side of church walls         blah blah blah  i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights  protects me better from fanatics than the other way round   of course  other people are always fanatics  never oneself   your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me      it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between  that argument and the rise of fanatism  so far  it is just another of your  assertions   so   you can do it               NUM   define  irrational belief    e g   is it rational to believe that            reason is always useful                    irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason  the latter has      been discussed for a long time with charley wingate  one point is that      the beliefs violate reason often  and another that a process that does      not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information           well  there is a glaring paradox here   an argument that reason is useful     based on reason would be circular  and argument not based on reason would     be irrational   which is it          that s bogus  self reference is not circular  and since the evaluation of    usefulness is possible within rational systems  it is allowed       o k   it s oval   it s still begging the question  however   and though   that certainly is allowed  it s not rational   and you claiming to be   rational and all         another of your assertions  no proof  no evidence  just claims   hey   i learned it from you  did i do good          at the risk of repeating myself  and hearing  we had that before   we   didn t hear a _refutation_ before  so we re back    deal with it      you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful   someone   who thinks reason is crap won t buy it  you see         that is unusually weak even for you  the latter implies that my proof  depends on their opinion  somehow who does not accept that there are  triangles won t accept pythagoras  wow  that s an incredible insight   i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion  it is possible to  show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims  unreliable or even absurd statements to be information   totally circular  and totally useless      their wish to believe makes them believe  things are judges by their appeal   and not by their information  it makes you feel good when you believe that  may be good for them  but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls  from  belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt   truth by blatant assertion   i ve seen as many bogus proofs of the  non existence of gods as i have of their existence       rational systems  by the way  does not mean that every data has to come from  logical analysis  the point is that the evaluation of the data does not  contradict logic  it easily follows that such a system does not allows to  evaluate if its rational in itself  yes  it is possible to evaluate that  it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that  system  but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon  that has as  little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes   this just doesn t parse  sorry      so far it just a matter of consistency  i use ratiional arguments to show  that my system is consistent or that theirs isn t  the evaluation of the  nor this   predictions does not need rationality  it does not contradict  however           your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics    and mathematics are therfore circular       anybody else think godel was silly         stream of consciousness typing  what is that supposed to mean            the first part of the second statement contains no information  because     you don t say what  the beliefs  are   if  the beliefs  are strong theism     and or strong atheism  then your statement is not in general true   the     second part of your sentence is patently false   counterexample  an     axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis  but is     assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is     used to obtain it              i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions    of god here         an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis  what you say here    is a an often refuted fallacy  have a look at the discussion of the    axiom of choice  and further  one can evaluate axioms in larger systems    out of which they are usually derived   i exist  is derived  if you want    it that way         further  one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms         what is it you are trying to say       that at some point  people always wind up saying  this datum is reliable    for no particular reason at all   example   i am not dreaming          nope  there is evidence for it  the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic  basis of a system is difficult  because the possibilities are interwoven   one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions  that are necessary to get information out of the

      " in article  NUMrNUMtqo ook horus ap mchp sni de              theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes  irrational          belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism          deletion           theism is correlated with fanaticism  i have neither said that all fanatism      is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism  the point is       theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic  one could of course      argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism  for example   but i just      have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology      to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it           imo  the influence of stalin  or for that matter  ayn rand  invalidates your     assumption that theism is the factor to be considered         bogus  i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism     the point is that theism is  a  factor       that s your claim  now back it up   i consider your argument as useful   as the following   belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism   therefore   belief is  a  factor in fanaticism   true  and utterly useless    note  this   is  any  belief  not belief in gods         tiring to say the least  i have backed it up  read the first statement   i have read it   conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point       the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy  saying someone believes  something is hardly an information about the person at all  saying someone  is a theist holds much more information  further  the correlation between  theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism  because of the special features of theistic belief   truth by blatant assertion   evidence            gullibility      blind obedience to authority  lack of scepticism  and so on  are all more     reliable indicators   and the really dangerous people   the sources of     fanaticism   are often none of these things   they are cynical manipulators     of the gullible  who know precisely what they are doing         that s a claim you have to support  please note that especially in the    field of theism  the leaders believe what they say       if you believe that  you re incredibly naive         you  frank o dwyer  are living in a dream world  i wonder if there is any  base of discussion left after such a statement  as a matter of fact  i think  you are ignorant of human nature  even when one starts with something one does  not believe  one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says      to give you the benefit of the doubt  prove your statement   the onus of proof is on you  sunshine   what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say   especially when they say one thing and do another  or say one thing closely followed by its opposite   the practice is not restricted to theism  but it s there for anyone to see   it s almost an epidemic in this country   just for instance  if it is harder for a camel to pass thru  the eye of a needle  why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner   why are there churches to the square inch in my country         now   some      brands of theism  and more precisely  some  theists  do tend to fanaticism      i grant you   to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry  not a reasoned     argument   and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction     of religious freedom   ever read animal farm          that s a straw man  and as usually in discussions with you one has to    repeat it  read what i have written above  not every theism leads to    fanatism  and not all fanatism is caused by theism  the point is     there is a correlation  and it comes from innate features of theism       no  some of it comes from features which  some  theism has in common   with  some  fanaticism     your last statement simply isn t implied by   what you say before  because you re trying to sneak in  innate features   of  all  theism    the word you re groping for is  some          bogus again  not all theism as is is fanatic  however  the rest already  gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and  theism  and further  the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them  to switch to fanatism easily  it takes just a nifty improvement in the  theology   truth by blatant assertion             gullibility  by the way  is one of them       no shit  sherlock   so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism    since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have  as opposed   to the case you are trying to make         because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people  causing the correlation  and the whole discussion started that way by the  statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism  which you  challenged   indeed i did   as i recall  i asked for evidence   what is the correlation of which you speak             and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw    men  interesting that you have nothing better to offer       i said it reads like a warm up to that   that s because it s an irrational   and bogus tirade  and has no other use than creating a nice them us   split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either   side of church walls         blah blah blah  i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights  protects me better from fanatics than the other way round   of course  other people are always fanatics  never oneself   your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me      it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between  that argument and the rise of fanatism  so far  it is just another of your  assertions   so   you can do it               NUM   define  irrational belief    e g   is it rational to believe that            reason is always useful                    irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason  the latter has      been discussed for a long time with charley wingate  one point is that      the beliefs violate reason often  and another that a process that does      not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information           well  there is a glaring paradox here   an argument that reason is useful     based on reason would be circular  and argument not based on reason would     be irrational   which is it          that s bogus  self reference is not circular  and since the evaluation of    usefulness is possible within rational systems  it is allowed       o k   it s oval   it s still begging the question  however   and though   that certainly is allowed  it s not rational   and you claiming to be   rational and all         another of your assertions  no proof  no evidence  just claims   hey   i learned it from you  did i do good          at the risk of repeating myself  and hearing  we had that before   we   didn t hear a _refutation_ before  so we re back    deal with it      you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful   someone   who thinks reason is crap won t buy it  you see         that is unusually weak even for you  the latter implies that my proof  depends on their opinion  somehow who does not accept that there are  triangles won t accept pythagoras  wow  that s an incredible insight   i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion  it is possible to  show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims  unreliable or even absurd statements to be information   totally circular  and totally useless      their wish to believe makes them believe  things are judges by their appeal   and not by their information  it makes you feel good when you believe that  may be good for them  but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls  from  belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt   truth by blatant assertion   i ve seen as many bogus proofs of the  non existence of gods as i have of their existence       rational systems  by the way  does not mean that every data has to come from  logical analysis  the point is that the evaluation of the data does not  contradict logic  it easily follows that such a system does not allows to  evaluate if its rational in itself  yes  it is possible to evaluate that  it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that  system  but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon  that has as  little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes   this just doesn t parse  sorry      so far it just a matter of consistency  i use ratiional arguments to show  that my system is consistent or that theirs isn t  the evaluation of the  nor this   predictions does not need rationality  it does not contradict  however           your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics    and mathematics are therfore circular       anybody else think godel was silly         stream of consciousness typing  what is that supposed to mean            the first part of the second statement contains no information  because     you don t say what  the beliefs  are   if  the beliefs  are strong theism     and or strong atheism  then your statement is not in general true   the     second part of your sentence is patently false   counterexample  an     axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis  but is     assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is     used to obtain it              i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions    of god here         an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis  what you say here    is a an often refuted fallacy  have a look at the discussion of the    axiom of choice  and further  one can evaluate axioms in larger systems    out of which they are usually derived   i exist  is derived  if you want    it that way         further  one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms         what is it you are trying to say       that at some point  people always wind up saying  this datum is reliable    for no particular reason at all   example   i am not dreaming          nope  there is evidence for it  the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic  basis of a system is difficult  because the possibilities are interwoven   one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions  that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway   i d like to see this alleged evidence      one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method  for usefulness  the foundation is laid by how one feels at all  that s not  how one feels about it    i see   you have no irrational beliefs   but then  fanatics never do  do they           compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of

                  from these two postulates  larson was able to build a            complete theoretical universe  from photons and subatomic            particles to the giant elliptical galaxies  by combining the            concept of inward and outward scalar motions with            translational  vibrational  rotational  and rotational            vibrational motions   at each step in the development  he was            able to match parts of his theoretical universe with            corresponding parts in the real physical universe  including            even things not yet discovered   for example  in his NUM            book  he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies             several years before astronomers started finding them   they            are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory   and            when quasars were discovered  he had a related explanation            ready for those also                             as a result of his theory  which he called  the            reciprocal system   larson totally rejected many of the            sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists             including black holes

galaxy            formation from the mythical  big bang  is a big mystery to            orthodox astronomers    he then goes on to describe life            cycles of stars and how binary and multiple

uniformly and do not correspond with any            visible objects   except for a few cases of directional            coincidence    larson s explanation is that the gamma ray            bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti matter            half of the physical universe  which larson calls the  cosmic            sector    because the anti matter universe exists in a            reciprocal relation to our material universe  with the speed            of light as the boundary between them  and has three            dimensions of time and only one dimension of space  the

it orbits  thus cleaning the space environment and bringing you the pause that refreshes at the same time   because of the large drag coefficient  it will de orbit    safely burning up    within a year   embedded in the foam structure is a small re entry vehicle  which does not burn up during entry   it contains the electronics and propulsion system  which may be refurbished and re used  as well as space science experiments proposed and built by high school students in advertiser sponsored science fairs   advertisers buy time on the billboard  whose surface is made up of tiny mirrors

from both the inside and the outside  i view it as harmful in many ways   it preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives  and once it s got these people  it teaches them to have pity  and sometimes starkly intolerant  of others who do not share these views   maybe you ll say that your religion doesn t teach that    but i ve got to judge christianity from the christians i know   i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one s self  and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that   so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think   i want christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever  and i want people who are considering christianity to realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy  fulfilled life   i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice things   i think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong  and they know the weaknesses of their religion  yet they still decide to believe  but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don t agree with them    precisely my point   you ve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem          just as the moslems aren t religious  and the buddhists aren t religious   who  is  religious  then  \n",

god  doesn t  exist     and so forth   all i m asking is for you to convince me   i want to be convinced  but it s not going to be easy    having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both the inside and the outside  i view it as harmful in many ways   it preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives  and once it s got these people  it teaches them to have pity  and sometimes starkly intolerant  of others who do not share these views   maybe you ll say that your religion doesn t teach that    but i ve got to judge christianity from the christians i know   i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one s self  and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason than that   so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some people think   i want christians to realize that there are perfectly valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity whatsoever  and i want people who are considering christianity to realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy  fulfilled life   i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice things   i think what sets these people apart from the general masses is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong  and they know the weaknesses of their religion  yet they still decide to believe  but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think any less of people who don t agree with them    precisely my point   you ve still not given me a reason to be a christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem          just as the moslems aren t religious  and the buddhists aren t religious   who  is  religious  then  \n",

         orthodox physicists  astronomers  and astrophysicists            claim to be looking for a  unified field theory  in which all            of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single            set of laws or equations   but they have been systematically            ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for NUM years                   the late physicist dewey b  larson s comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe  which he            calls the  reciprocal system   is built on two fundamental            postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of            space and time                        NUM   the physical universe is composed entirely of one            component  motion  existing in three dimensions  in discrete            units  and in two reciprocal forms  space and time                         NUM   the physical universe conforms to the relations of            ordinary commutative mathematics  its magnitudes are            absolute  and its geometry is euclidean                        from these two postulates  larson developed a complete            theoretical universe  using various combinations of            translational  vibrational  rotational  and vibrational            rotational motions  the concepts of in ward and out ward            scalar motions  and speeds in relation to the speed of light             which larson called  unit velocity  and  the natural            datum                           at each step in the development  larson was able to            match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the            real physical universe   photons  sub atomic particles             incomplete atoms   charges  atoms  molecules  globular star            clusters  galaxies  binary star systems  solar systems  white            dwarf stars  pulsars  quasars  etc    even objects not yet            discovered then  such as exploding galaxies  and gamma ray            bursts                              and applying his theory to his new model of the atom             larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter            atomic distances in crystals and molecules  compressibility            and thermal expansion of solids  and other properties of            matter                   all of this is described in good detail

dewey b  larson s background                     physicist dewey b  larson was a retired engineer             chemical or electrical    he was about NUM years old when he            died in may NUM   he had a bachelor of science degree in            engineering science from oregon state university   he            developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute            chemical properties based only on the elements used                       larson s lack of a fancy  ph d   degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him  but it is            not a valid reason   sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to clearly see the forest through the trees   at the same            time  it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox            physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer             well enough to point out all their contradictions  ad hoc            assumptions  principles of impotence  in consistencies  etc                         larson did not have the funds  etc  to experimentally            test his theory   and it was not necessary for him to do so              he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other            researchers  experimental and observational data   and in            many cases  his explanation fit better                       a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox            physicists and astronomers have   they claim to be looking            for a  unified field theory  that works  but have been            ignoring one for over NUM years now                        modern physics  does not explain the physical universe            so well   some parts of some of larson s books are full of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree   and remember that  epicycles    crystal spheres               geocentricity    flat earth theory   etc   also once seemed            to explain it well  but were later proved conceptually wrong                            prof  frank h  meyer  professor

really just atoms of anti matter  which are            created by the high energy colliding beams  and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment                       a larger and more expensive collider will only create a            few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not            seen there before  and the physicists will be even more            confused than they are now                       are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the  NUM NUM            billion cost     don t we have much more important uses for            this wasted money                              another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of  fire ants  eating the insulation off underground            cables   how much poisoning of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the  supercollider                                    naming the  super collider  after ronald reagon  as            proposed  is totally absurd   if it is built  it should be            named after a leading particle physicist                      larsonian anti matter                           in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe  anti matter is not a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles   it has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made  in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light             which larson calls  unit velocity  and the  natural datum                         in larson s theory  a positron is actually a particle of            matter  not anti matter   when a positron and electron meet             the rotational vibrations  charges  and rotations of their            respective photons  of which they are made  neutralize each            other                         in larson s theory  the anti matter half of the physical            universe has three dimensions of time  and only one dimension            of space  and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our            material half                       larsonian relativity                           the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the            rate of NUM seconds of arc per century   NUM seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets  venus  earth  jupiter             etc     the remaining NUM seconds of arc are being used to            help  prove  einstein s  general theory of relativity                        but the late physicist dewey b  larson achieved results            closer to the NUM seconds than  general relativity  can  by            instead using  special relativity    in one or more of his            books  he applied the lorentz transformation on the high            orbital speed of mercury                       larson totally rejected  general relativity  as another            mathematical fantasy   he also rejected most of  special            relativity   including the parts about  mass increases  near            the speed of light  and the use of the lorentz transform on            doppler shifts   those quasars with red shifts greater than            NUM NUM really are moving faster than the speed of light             although most of that motion is away from us in time                          in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe  there are three dimensions of time instead            of only one   but two of those dimensions can not be measured            from our material half of the physical universe   the one            dimension that we can measure is the clock time   at low            relative speeds  the values of the other two dimensions are            negligible  but at high speeds  they become significant  and            the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor              larson often used the term  coordinate time  when writing            about this                              in regard to  mass increases   it has been proven in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light   but the formula for acceleration is            acceleration   force   mass   a   f m    orthodox physicists            are ignoring the third factor  force   in larson s theory             mass stays constant and force drops toward zero   force is            actually a motion  or combinations of motions  or relations            between motions  including inward and outward scalar motions              the expansion of the universe  for example  is an outward            scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of            the so called  big bang   which is yet another mathematical            fantasy                                                                   the universe of motion                 i wish to recommend to everyone the book  the universe

the astrophysical portions of a general            unified theory of the physical universe developed by that            author  an unrecognized genius  more than thirty years ago                       it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical            mysteries  including the formation of galaxies  binary and            multiple star systems  and solar systems  the true origin of            the  NUM degree  background radiation  cosmic rays  and gamma            ray bursts  and the true nature of quasars  pulsars  white            dwarfs  exploding galaxies  etc                        it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all            looking for  if they are ready to seriously consider it with            open minds                       the following is an example of his theory s success             in his first book in NUM   the structure of the physical            universe   larson predicted the existence of exploding            galaxies  several years before astronomers started finding            them   they are a necessary consequence of larson s            comprehensive theory   and when quasars were discovered  he            had an immediate related explanation for them also                     gamma ray bursts                 astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts   they were            originally thought to originate from  neutron stars  in the            disc of our galaxy   but the new gamma ray telescope now in            earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly  and their source locations in space do not            correspond to any known objects   except for a few cases of            directional coincidence                        gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the            general unified theory of the physical universe developed by            the late physicist dewey b  larson   according to page NUM of            his book  the universe of motion   published in NUM  the            gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the            anti matter half of the physical universe  which larson calls            the  cosmic sector    because of the relationship between the            anti matter and material halves of the physical universe  and            the way they are connected together  the gamma ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space  seemingly at            random    this is why the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects  and come from all            directions uniformly                        i wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most            life on earth   there would be no way to predict one  nor to            stop it                       perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past  which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids  were            actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts                    larsonian binary star formation                           about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double   but orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them                       but binary star systems are actually a likely            consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of            the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey            b  larson                       i will try to summarize larsons explanation  which is            detailed in chapter NUM of his book  the universe of motion             and in some of his other books                       first of all  according to larson  stars do not generate            energy by  fusion    a small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse   the rest results from the complete            annihilation of heavy elements  heavier than iron    each            element has a destructive temperature limit   the heavier the            element is  the lower is this limit   a star s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays  gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements                       when the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of iron  there is a type i            supernova explosion   this is because there is so much iron            present  and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process  which larson explains in some            of his books  better than i can                        when the star explodes  the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light   the heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light  because of the high temperature   the            explosion pushes that material over the speed of light  and            it expands outward in time  which is equivalent to inward in            space  and it often actually disappears for a while                       over long periods of time  both masses start to fall            back gravitationally   the material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a red giant star   the            material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a            white dwarf star   both stars then start moving back toward            the  main sequence  from opposite directions on the h r            diagram                       the chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space  making a single lone star            again  are near zero   they will instead form a binary            system  orbiting each other                        according to larson  a white dwarf star has an inverse            density gradient  is densest at its surface   because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed  blown            outward  in time    this eliminates the need to resort to            mathematical fantasies about  degenerate matter    neutron            stars    black holes   etc                     larsonian solar system formation                 if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively small  then  instead of a single            white dwarf star  there will be several  mini  white dwarf            stars  revolving around the red giant star  but probably            still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected            by its heat  etc     these will become planets                         in chapter NUM of the universe of motion  larson used all            this information  and other principles of his comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe  to derive            his own version of bode s law                           black hole  fantasy                  i heard that physicist stephen w  hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two  black            holes  merging together into a single  black hole   and            concluded that the new  black hole  would have more mass than            the sum of the two original  black holes                        such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red            flag  causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of  black            holes   etc                        after reading physicist dewey b  larson s books about            his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe  especially his book  the universe of motion   it is            clear to me that  black holes  are nothing more than            mathematical fantasies   the strange object at cygnus x NUM is            just an unusually massive white dwarf star  not the  black            hole  that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to  prove  their theory                            by the way  i do not understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist stephen hawking   the physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical            problem somehow makes him  wiser    it does not                       i wish the same attention had been given to physicist            dewey b  larson while he was still alive   widespread            publicity and attention should now be given to larson s            theory  books  and organization  the international society of            unified science                                               electro magnetic propulsion                 i heard of that concept many years ago  in connection            with ufo s and unorthodox inventors  but i never was able to            find out how or why they work  or how they are constructed                       i found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages NUM NUM of the book  basic properties of matter   by            the late physicist dewey b  larson  which describes part of            larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe   i quote one paragraph                        as indicated in the preceding chapter  the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance              the electrons  we find  are derived from the environment   it            was brought out in volume i  larson s book  nothing but            motion   that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities  and that             although the motions that constitute these electrons are  in            many cases  absorbed by atomic structures  the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited   it follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector  material half  of the            universe  most of which are uncharged   in this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space  because they are inherently rotating units of space             and the relation of space to space is not motion   in open            space  therefore  each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system  in the manner of a photon   in the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron             like the photon  is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system   all            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation              meanwhile there are other processes  to be discussed later             whereby electrons are returned to the environment   the            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level                              note that in larson s theory  uncharged electrons are            also massless  and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency  above the  unit  frequency  spinning            around one axis at a particular rate  below the  unit  rate                 unit velocity  is the speed of light  and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light             according to larson s theory     i might have the  above  and             below  labels mixed up                        larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass            less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light                       if this is true  then the electro magnetic propulsion            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons  or other particles in space  perhaps giving them a            charge  and mass  and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion   in larson s theory  an electrical charge            is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency  above the  unit  frequency  superimposed on the            rotation of the particle                          the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds                suppression of larsonian physics                 the comprehensive general unified theory of

magnitudes are            absolute  and its geometry is euclidean                        from these two postulates  larson developed a complete            theoretical universe  using various combinations of            translational  vibrational  rotational  and vibrational            rotational motions  the concepts of in ward and out ward            scalar motions  and speeds in relation

dewey b  larson s background                     physicist dewey b  larson was a retired engineer             chemical or electrical    he was about NUM years old when he            died in may NUM   he had a bachelor of science degree in            engineering science from oregon state university   he            developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute            chemical properties based only on the elements used                       larson s lack of a fancy  ph d   degree might be one            reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him  but it is            not a valid reason   sometimes it takes a relative outsider            to clearly see the forest through the trees   at the same            time  it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox            physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer             well enough to point out all their contradictions  ad hoc            assumptions  principles of impotence  in consistencies  etc                         larson did not have the funds  etc  to experimentally            test his theory   and it was not necessary for him to do so              he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other            researchers  experimental and observational data   and in            many cases  his explanation fit better                       a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox            physicists and astronomers have   they claim to be looking            for a  unified field theory  that works  but have been            ignoring one for over NUM years now                        modern physics  does not explain the physical universe            so well   some parts of some of larson s books are full of            quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who            agree   and remember that  epicycles    crystal spheres               geocentricity    flat earth theory   etc   also once seemed            to explain it well  but were later proved conceptually wrong                            prof  frank h  meyer  professor emeritus of uw superior             was is a strong proponent of larson s theory  and was  or            still is  president of larson s organization   the            international society of unified

am against contruction of the  superconducting super            collider   in texas or anywhere else   it would be a gross            waste of money  and contribute almost nothing of  scientific             value                       most physicists don t realize it  but  according to the            comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist            dewey b  larson  as described in his books  the strange goofy            particles   mesons    hyperons   alleged  quarks   etc              which they are finding in existing colliders  fermi lab             cern  etc   are really just atoms of anti matter  which are            created by the high energy colliding beams  and which quickly            disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible            with their environment                       a larger and more expensive collider will only create a            few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not            seen there before  and the physicists will be even more            confused than they are now                       are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the  NUM NUM            billion cost     don t we have much more important uses for            this wasted money                              another thing to consider is that the primary proposed            location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some            kind of  fire ants  eating the insulation off underground            cables   how much poisoning of the ground and ground water            with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of            the  supercollider                                    naming the  super collider  after ronald reagon  as            proposed  is totally absurd   if it is built  it should be            named after a leading particle physicist                      larsonian anti matter                           in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe  anti matter is not a simple case of            opposite charges of the same types of particles   it has more            to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the            photons of which they are made  in relation to the            vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light             which larson calls  unit velocity  and the  natural datum                         in larson s theory  a positron is actually a particle of            matter  not anti matter   when a positron and electron meet             the rotational vibrations  charges  and rotations of their            respective photons  of which they are made  neutralize each            other                         in larson s theory  the anti matter half of the physical            universe has three dimensions of time  and only one dimension            of space  and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our            material half                       larsonian relativity                           the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury            has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the            rate of NUM seconds of arc per century   NUM seconds of this            advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational            perturbations from the other planets  venus  earth  jupiter             etc     the remaining NUM seconds of arc are being used to            help  prove  einstein s  general theory of relativity                        but the late physicist dewey b  larson achieved results            closer to the NUM seconds than  general relativity  can  by            instead using  special relativity    in one or more of his            books  he applied the lorentz transformation on the high            orbital speed of mercury                       larson totally rejected  general relativity  as another            mathematical fantasy   he also rejected most of  special            relativity   including the parts about  mass increases  near            the speed of light  and the use of the lorentz transform on            doppler shifts   those quasars with red shifts greater than            NUM NUM really are moving faster than the speed of light             although most of that motion is away from us in time                          in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the            physical universe  there are three dimensions of time instead            of only one   but two of those dimensions can not be measured            from our material half of the physical universe   the one            dimension that we can measure is the clock time   at low            relative speeds  the values of the other two dimensions are            negligible  but at high speeds  they become significant  and            the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor              larson often used the term  coordinate time  when writing            about this                              in regard to  mass increases   it has been proven in            atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near            the speed of light   but the formula for acceleration is            acceleration   force   mass   a   f m    orthodox physicists            are ignoring the third factor  force   in larson s theory             mass stays constant and force drops toward zero   force is            actually a motion  or combinations of motions  or relations            between motions  including inward and outward scalar motions              the expansion of the universe  for example  is an outward            scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of            the so called  big bang   which is yet another mathematical            fantasy                                                                   the universe of motion                 i wish to recommend to everyone the book  the universe

the astrophysical portions of a general            unified theory of the physical universe developed by that            author  an unrecognized genius  more than thirty years ago                       it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical            mysteries  including the formation of galaxies  binary and            multiple star systems  and solar systems  the true origin of            the  NUM degree  background radiation  cosmic rays  and gamma            ray bursts  and the true nature of quasars  pulsars  white            dwarfs  exploding galaxies  etc                        it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all            looking for  if they are ready to seriously consider it with            open minds                       the following is an example of his theory s success             in his first book in NUM   the structure of the physical            universe   larson predicted the existence of exploding            galaxies  several years before astronomers started finding            them   they are a necessary consequence of larson s            comprehensive theory   and when quasars were discovered  he            had an immediate related explanation for them also                     gamma ray bursts                 astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching            their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts   they were            originally thought to originate from  neutron stars  in the            disc of our galaxy   but the new gamma ray telescope now in            earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions            uniformly  and their source locations in space do not            correspond to any known objects   except for a few cases of            directional coincidence                        gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the            general unified theory of the physical universe developed by            the late physicist dewey b  larson   according to page NUM of            his book  the universe of motion   published in NUM  the            gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the            anti matter half of the physical universe  which larson calls            the  cosmic sector    because of the relationship between the            anti matter and material halves of the physical universe  and            the way they are connected together  the gamma ray bursts can            pop into our material half anywhere in space  seemingly at            random    this is why the source locations of the bursts do            not correspond with known objects  and come from all            directions uniformly                        i wonder how close to us in space a source location            would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most            life on earth   there would be no way to predict one  nor to            stop it                       perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past  which            are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids  were            actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts                    larsonian binary star formation                           about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the            vicinity of the sun are binary or double   but orthodox            astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory            theory about how they form or why there are so many of them                       but binary star systems are actually a likely            consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of            the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey            b  larson                       i will try to summarize larsons explanation  which is            detailed in chapter NUM of his book  the universe of motion             and in some of his other books                       first of all  according to larson  stars do not generate            energy by  fusion    a small fraction comes from slow            gravitational collapse   the rest results from the complete            annihilation of heavy elements  heavier than iron    each            element has a destructive temperature limit   the heavier the            element is  the lower is this limit   a star s internal            temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and            absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays  gradually            reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and            lighter elements                       when the internal temperature of the star reaches the            destructive temperature limit of iron  there is a type i            supernova explosion   this is because there is so much iron            present  and that is related to the structure of iron atoms            and the atom building process  which larson explains in some            of his books  better than i can                        when the star explodes  the lighter material on the            outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less            than the speed of light   the heavier material in the center            portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to            the speed of light  because of the high temperature   the            explosion pushes that material over the speed of light  and            it expands outward in time  which is equivalent to inward in            space  and it often actually disappears for a while                       over long periods of time  both masses start to fall            back gravitationally   the material that had been blown            outward in space now starts to form a red giant star   the            material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a            white dwarf star   both stars then start moving back toward            the  main sequence  from opposite directions on the h r            diagram                       the chances of the two masses falling back into the            exact same location in space  making a single lone star            again  are near zero   they will instead form a binary            system  orbiting each other                        according to larson  a white dwarf star has an inverse            density gradient  is densest at its surface   because the            material at its center is most widely dispersed  blown            outward  in time    this eliminates the need to resort to            mathematical fantasies about  degenerate matter    neutron            stars    black holes   etc                     larsonian solar system formation                 if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the            exploding star is relatively small  then  instead of a single            white dwarf star  there will be several  mini  white dwarf            stars  revolving around the red giant star  but probably            still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected            by its heat  etc     these will become planets                         in chapter NUM of the universe of motion  larson used all            this information  and other principles of his comprehensive            general unified theory of the physical universe  to derive            his own version of bode s law                           black hole  fantasy                  i heard that physicist stephen w  hawking recently            completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two  black            holes  merging together into a single  black hole   and            concluded that the new  black hole  would have more mass than            the sum of the two original  black holes                        such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red            flag  causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of  black            holes   etc                        after reading physicist dewey b  larson s books about            his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe  especially his book  the universe of motion   it is            clear to me that  black holes  are nothing more than            mathematical fantasies   the strange object at cygnus x NUM is            just an unusually massive white dwarf star  not the  black            hole  that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want            to  prove  their theory                            by the way  i do not understand why so much publicity is            being given to physicist stephen hawking   the physicists and            astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical            problem somehow makes him  wiser    it does not                       i wish the same attention had been given to physicist            dewey b  larson while he was still alive   widespread            publicity and attention should now be given to larson s            theory  books  and organization  the international society of            unified science                                               electro magnetic propulsion                 i heard of that concept many years ago  in connection            with ufo s and unorthodox inventors  but i never was able to            find out how or why they work  or how they are constructed                       i found a possible clue about why they might work on            pages NUM NUM of the book  basic properties of matter   by            the late physicist dewey b  larson  which describes part of            larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe   i quote one paragraph                        as indicated in the preceding chapter  the development            of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally            different concept of the nature of electrical resistance              the electrons  we find  are derived from the environment   it            was brought out in volume i  larson s book  nothing but            motion   that there are physical processes in operation which            produce electrons in substantial quantities  and that             although the motions that constitute these electrons are  in            many cases  absorbed by atomic structures  the opportunities            for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are            limited   it follows that there is always a large excess of            free electrons in the material sector  material half  of the            universe  most of which are uncharged   in this uncharged            state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension            space  because they are inherently rotating units of space             and the relation of space to space is not motion   in open            space  therefore  each uncharged electron remains permanently            in the same location with respect to the natural reference            system  in the manner of a photon   in the context of the            stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron             like the photon  is carried outward at the speed of light by            the progression of the natural reference system   all            material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons            similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation              meanwhile there are other processes  to be discussed later             whereby electrons are returned to the environment   the            electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth            therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level                              note that in larson s theory  uncharged electrons are            also massless  and are basically photons of light of a            particular frequency  above the  unit  frequency  spinning            around one axis at a particular rate  below the  unit  rate                 unit velocity  is the speed of light  and there are            vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light             according to larson s theory     i might have the  above  and             below  labels mixed up                        larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass            less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of            light                       if this is true  then the electro magnetic propulsion            fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these            electrons  or other particles in space  perhaps giving them a            charge  and mass  and shooting them toward the rear to            achieve propulsion   in larson s theory  an electrical charge            is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular            frequency  above the  unit  frequency  superimposed on the            rotation of the particle                          the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to            confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is            generated in clouds                suppression of larsonian physics                 the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical            universe developed by the late physicist dewey b  larson has            been available for more than NUM years  published in NUM in            his first book  the structure of the physical universe                        it is totally un scientific for hawking  wheeler  sagan             and the other sacred priests of the religion they call             science   or  physics   or  astronomy   etc    as well as            the  scientific  literature and the  education  systems  to            totally ignore larson s theory has they have                       larson s theory has excellent explanations for many            things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers  such            as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars                       larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly            discussed in the physics  chemistry  and astronomy journals             in the u s  and elsewhere   and at least the basic principles            of larson s theory should be included in all related courses            at uw ec  uw madison  cambridge  cornell university  and            elsewhere  so that students are not kept in the dark about a            worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed                                   for more information  answers to your questions  etc              please consult my cited

it comes from the hebrew gai hinnom  meaning  valley of hinniom    hinnom is a  deep  narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem       in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites  including  infant sacrifice  it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made  their children  pass through the fire  to the god molech   the rites were  specifically celebrated in tophet  the  place of abhorrence   one of the chief  groves in the valley        king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations   he  defiled the

  where will this temporary lake of fire  this  hell   be       the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast   for  tophet  in the valley of hinnom  is ordained of old  yea for

NUM    to the righteous  god says that the wicked shall be  ashes under the  soles of your feet     mal NUM NUM        gehenna was a place of destruction and death  not a place of living  torture   jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or  valley of hinnom   utter destruction by fire was complete   nothing was left   but ashes        every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means  complete destruction  not living torture  not eternal life in torment    the  bible says  in romans NUM NUM   the wages of sin is death   not eternal life in

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
